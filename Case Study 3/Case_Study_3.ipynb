      "LIMA, Peru (Reuters) -- Lina Medina's parents thought their 5-year-old daughter had a huge abdominal tumor and when shamans in their remote village in Peru's Andes could find no cure, her father carried her to hospital. \n",
      "\n",
      "Just over a month later, she gave birth to a boy. \n",
      "\n",
      "Aged 5 years, seven months and 21 days old when her child was born by Caesarean section in May 1939, Medina made medical history, and is still the youngest known mother in the world. \n",
      "\n",
      "At the time, Peru's government promised aid that never materialized. Six decades on, Medina lives with her husband in a cramped house in a poor, crime-ridden district of the Peruvian capital known as \"Little Chicago.\" \n",
      "\n",
      "Now 68, she keeps herself to herself and has long refused requests to rake up the past. Gerardo, the son she delivered while still a child herself, died in 1979 at the age of 40. \n",
      "\n",
      "But a new book, written by an obstetrician who has been interested in her case, has drawn fresh attention to Medina's story, and raised the prospect that the Peruvian government may belatedly offer her financial and other assistance. \n",
      "\n",
      "\"The government condemned them to live in poverty. In any other country, they would be the objects of special care,\" Jose Sandoval, author of \"Mother Aged 5,\" told Reuters. \n",
      "\n",
      "\"We still have time to repair the damage done to her. That's my fundamental objective,\" he added. \n",
      "\n",
      "'Totally willing to help'\n",
      "Sandoval has raised Medina's case with the office of first lady Eliane Karp, and has asked the government to grant her a life pension -- something officials say is possible. \n",
      "\n",
      "\"We're totally willing to help her,\" said spokeswoman Marta Castaneda. But Suni Ramos, of the social action department of Karp's office, said that before the government could grant her a pension or any other of the aid it was already planning -- such as kitchen and other household equipment -- it needed to talk to her to discuss what she wanted and needed. It is currently trying to contact Medina and her family. \n",
      "\n",
      "Medina's husband, Raul Jurado, told Reuters his wife remained skeptical. \"She got no help (in 1939) that I know about,\" he said. \"She thinks governments never deliver. Maybe today there will be a promise that will never come true.\" \n",
      "\n",
      "Jurado said his wife, whose story is a medical textbook classic and whose case is confirmed as true by such bodies as the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, had turned down Reuters' request for an interview. \n",
      "\n",
      "Medical rarity\n",
      "No one has ever established who was the father of Medina's child, or confirmed she became pregnant after being raped. \n",
      "\n",
      "One of nine children born to country folk in Ticrapo, an Andean village at an altitude of 7,400 feet (2,250 meters) in Peru's poorest province, Medina is believed to be the youngest case of precocious puberty in history, Sandoval said. \n",
      "\n",
      "He said she had her first period at 2 1/2, became pregnant aged 4 years and eight months and that when doctors performed the Caesarean to deliver her baby, they found she already had fully mature sexual organs. \n",
      "\n",
      "Her swelling stomach worried her parents. \"They thought it was a tumor,\" he said. But shamans ruled out village superstitions -- including one in which locals believed a snake grew inside a person until it killed them -- and recommended they take her to hospital in the nearest big town, Pisco. \n",
      "\n",
      "There came the staggering diagnosis that she was pregnant. \n",
      "\n",
      "Her father was jailed temporarily on suspicion of incest -- he was later released for lack of evidence -- and doctors, police and even a film crew set off for her village for preliminary investigations into her case. \n",
      "\n",
      "Sandoval, who based his book on media and other published information, and some interviews with relatives as Medina herself declined to comment, said news of the child mother-to-be drew instant offers of aid, including one worth $5,000 from a U.S. businessman, which was turned down. \n",
      "\n",
      "More offers followed after Medina was transferred to a Lima hospital, where her fully developed 6-pound (2.7 kg) baby was born on May 14, 1939 -- Mother's Day. \n",
      "\n",
      "One offer was worth $1,000 a week, plus expenses, for Medina and her baby to be exhibited at the World's Fair in New York. Another, from a U.S. business that the family accepted in early June 1939, was for the pair to travel to the United States for scientists to study the case. The offer included setting up a fund to ensure their lifelong financial comfort. \n",
      "\n",
      "But within days, the state trumped all previous offers, decreeing that Medina and her baby were in \"moral danger,\" and resolving to set up a special commission to protect them. \n",
      "\n",
      "But Sandoval said: \"It abandoned the case after six months ...It did absolutely nothing for them.\" \n",
      "\n",
      "Happy ending?\n",
      "Though physically mature, Medina -- who Sandoval said was mentally normal and showed no other unusual medical symptoms -- still behaved like a child, preferring to play with her dolls instead of the new baby, who was fed by a wet nurse. \n",
      "\n",
      "Medina stayed in hospital for 11 months, finally returning to her family after it began legal proceedings that led to a Supreme Court ruling allowing her to live with them again. \n",
      "\n",
      "After taunting from schoolmates, Gerardo -- who was named after one of the doctors who attended Medina and became their mentor -- discovered when he was 10 that the woman he had grown up believing to be his sister was in fact his mother. \n",
      "\n",
      "He died in 1979 from a disease that attacks the body's bone marrow, but Sandoval said it was not clear there was any link with his illness and the fact his mother had been so young. \n",
      "\n",
      "Medina married and in 1972 had a second son, 33 years after her first. Her second child now lives in Mexico. \n",
      "\n",
      "She appears to have turned her bizarre story into a taboo subject. \"We just want to get on with our lives, that's it,\" said Jurado, adding he thought \"absolutely nothing\" of the fact his wife was the world's youngest mother. \n",
      "\n",
      "He said the couple's main concern now, if the government's offer of aid was genuine, was to be granted the value of a property that belonged to Medina and which the then-government expropriated more than two decades ago. That house has now been destroyed and there is a road on the site. \n",
      "\n",
      "He said its value was \"more or less $25,000\" and settling the property question would conclude a long legal battle to get back a home of their own -- they live now in a modest house, accessed down a dingy alley half blocked by a wooden board, in a tough neighborhood known to locals as a thieves' paradise. \n",
      "\n",
      "\"If the government really wants to help...they should give us the value of our property,\" he said. \n",
      "\n",
      "As for Sandoval, he said he was optimistic that Medina's story, which he has studied since his student days, would turn out well. \"I believe there will be a happy ending,\" he said. \n",
      "\n",
      "\"As a result of the war, corporations have now been enthroned and an era\n",
      "of corruption in high places will follow and the money-power of the\n",
      "country will endeavor to prolong its reign by working upon the\n",

      "Just look at my textbook, he said, and when I did I saw his point. His \n",

      "beefing up of the roles of Sacagawea and Crispus Attucks, and, in-deed, \n",
      "there was some of that. But the main difference between my son's text \n",

      "decision to devote most of it to what had actually happened in American \n",
      "history. There were pages and pages on tariffs and bank charters and \n",
      "reciprocal trade agreements. I skipped ahead, past the Civil War, hoping \n",

      "Even now, if one were to reveal what really goes on behind the pretty \n",
      "speeches and the sanctimonious hearings in Washington, what you'd find \n",
      "is thousands of lawyers and lobbyists madly vying for advantage, not so \n",
      "much over the public as over each other: agribusiness versus real \n",
      "estate, banks versus insurance companies, and so on. The arena in which \n",
      "this competition mainly takes place is regulatory agencies and \n",
      "commissions and the congressional committees that supervise them. It's \n",
      "an insider's game, less because the players are secretive than because \n",
      "the public and the press—encouraged by the players, who speak in jargon—\n",

      "\n",
      "Of all the federal agencies and commissions, the F.C.C. is the one that \n",
      "Americans ought to be most interested in; after all, it is involved with \n",
      "a business sector that accounts for about fifteen per cent of the \n",
      "American economy, as well as important aspects of daily life—telephone \n",
      "and television and radio and newspapers and the Internet. And right now \n",
      "F.C.C. World is in, if not a crisis, at least a very soapy lather, \n",
      "because a good portion of what the angry public thinks of as the \n",

      "regulated by the F.C.C. Qwest, WorldCom, Adelphia, and Global Crossing, \n",

      "analyst who seems to have succeeded Kenneth Lay, of Enron, as the \n",
      "embodiment of the corporate scandals, is part of F.C.C. World. In the \n",
      "past two years, companies belonging to F.C.C. World have lost trillions \n",
      "of dollars in stock-market valuation, and have collectively served as a \n",
      "dead weight pulling down the entire stock market.\n",
      "\n",
      "This year, an alarmed and acerbic anonymous memorandum about the state \n",
      "of the F.C.C. has been circulating widely within F.C.C. World. It evokes \n",
      "F.C.C. World's feverish mood (\"The F.C.C. is fiddling while Rome burns\") \n",
      "and suggests why nobody besides residents of F.C.C. World has thought of \n",
      "the commission in connection with the corporate scandals. The sentence I \n",
      "just quoted is followed by this explanation: \"The ILECs appear likely to \n",

      "residential customers to attackers since 1996, and suffering about 10% \n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Even in good times, F.C.C. World pays obsessive attention to the \n",
      "commission's chairman. In bad times, the attention becomes especially \n",
      "intense; and when the chairman is a celebrity F.C.C. World devotes \n",
      "itself to full-time chairman-watching. The current chairman, Michael \n",
      "Powell, is a celebrity, at least by government-official standards, \n",
      "because he is the only son of Colin Powell, the Secretary of State. \n",
      "Unlike his father, he has a kind of mesmerizing ambiguity, which \n",
      "generates enormous, and at times apoplectically toned, speculation about \n",
      "who he really is and what he's really up to. Powell is young to be the \n",
      "head of a federal agency—he is thirty-nine—and genially charming. \n",
      "Everybody likes him. Before becoming chairman, he was for three years \n",
      "one of the F.C.C.'s five commissioners; not only is he fluent in the \n",
      "F.C.C.'s incomprehensible patois, he has a Clintonesque love of the \n",
      "arcane details of communications policy. He's always saying that he's an \n",
      "\"avid moderate.\" And yet he has a rage-inciting quality. One of his \n",
      "predecessors as chairman, Reed Hundt, quoted in Forbes, compared Powell \n",
      "to Herbert Hoover. Mark Cooper, of the Consumer Federation of America, \n",
      "calls him \"radical and extreme.\" Just as often as he's accused of being \n",
      "a right-wing ideologue, Powell gets accused of being paralytically \n",
      "cautious. \"It ain't about singing 'Kum-Ba-Yah' around the campfire,\" \n",
      "another former chairman, William Kennard, says. \"You have to have an \n",
      "answer.\" One day last spring, Powell, testifying before a Senate \n",
      "subcommittee, delivered an anodyne opening statement, and the \n",
      "subcommittee's chairman, Ernest Hollings, of South Carolina, berated \n",
      "him. \"You don't care about these regulations,\" Hollings said. \"You don't \n",
      "care about the law or what Congress sets down. . . . That's the \n",
      "fundamental. That's the misgiving I have of your administration over \n",
      "there. It just is amazing to me. You just pell-mell down the road and \n",
      "seem to not care at all. I think you'd be a wonderful executive \n",
      "vice-president of a chamber of commerce, but not a chairman of a \n",
      "regulatory commission at the government level. Are you happy in your \n",
      "job?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Extremely,\" Powell said, with an amiable smile.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "One cannot understand Powell's maddening effect, at least on Democrats \n",
      "and liberal activists, without understanding not just the stated purpose \n",
      "of the commission he chairs but also its real purpose. The F.C.C. was \n",
      "created by Congress in 1934, but it existed in prototype well before the \n",
      "New Deal, because it performs a function that is one of the classic easy \n",
      "cases for government intervention in the private economy: making sure \n",
      "that broadcasters stick to their assigned spots on the airwaves. Its \n",
      "other original function was preventing American Telephone & Telegraph, \n",
      "the national monopoly phone company, from treating its customers \n",
      "unfairly. Over the decades, as F.C.C. World grew up into a comfortable, \n",
      "well-established place, the F.C.C. segued into the role of industrial \n",
      "supervision—its real purpose. It was supposed to manage the competition \n",
      "among communications companies so that it didn't become too bloody, by \n",
      "artfully deciding who would be allowed to enter what line of business. \n",
      "In addition to looking out for the public's interest, the commission \n",
      "more specifically protected the interests of members of Congress, many \n",
      "of whom regard the media companies in their districts as the single most \n",
      "terrifying category of interest group—you can cross the local bank \n",
      "president and live to tell the tale, but not the local broadcaster. \n",
      "According to an oft-told F.C.C. World anecdote, President Clinton once \n",
      "blocked an attempt to allow television stations to buy daily newspapers \n",
      "in the same city because, he said, if the so-and-so who owned the \n",
      "anti-Clinton Little Rock Democrat-Gazette had owned the leading TV \n",
      "station in Little Rock, too, Clinton would never have become President.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "F.C.C. World may have been con tentious, but it was settled, too, \n",
      "because all the reasonably powerful players had created secure economic \n",
      "niches for themselves. Then, in the nineteen-eighties, the successful \n",
      "breakup of A.T. & T.—by far the biggest and most important company the \n",
      "commission regulated—deposited a thick additional sediment of \n",
      "self-confidence onto the consciousness of F.C.C. World. A generation \n",
      "ago, for most Americans, there was one local phone company, one \n",
      "long-distance company, and one company that manufactured telephones, \n",
      "which customers were not permitted to own—and they were all the same \n",
      "company. It was illegal to plug any device into a phone line. By the \n",
      "mid-nineteen-nineties, there were a dozen economically viable local \n",
      "phone companies, a handful of national long-distance companies competing \n",
      "to offer customers the lowest price and best service, and stores \n",
      "everywhere selling telephone equipment from many manufacturers—and \n",
      "millions of Americans had a fax machine and a modem operating over the \n",
      "telephone lines. A.T. & T. had argued for years that it was a \"natural \n",
      "monopoly,\" requiring protection from economic competition and total \n",
      "control over its lines. So much for that argument. Over the same period, \n",
      "the F.C.C. had assisted in the birth of cable television and cell phones \n",
      "and the Internet. It was the dream of federal-agency success come true: \n",
      "consumers vastly better served, and the industry much bigger and more \n",
      "prosperous, too.\n",
      "\n",
      "The next big step was supposed to be the Telecommunications Act of 1996, \n",
      "one of those massive, endlessly lobbied-over pieces of legislation which \n",
      "most people outside F.C.C. World probably felt it was safe to ignore. \n",
      "Although the Telecom Act sailed under the rhetorical banner of \n",
      "modernization and deregulation, its essence was a grand interest-group \n",
      "bargain, in which the local phone companies, known to headline writers \n",
      "as \"baby Bells\" and to F.C.C. World as \"arbocks\" (the pronounced version \n",
      "of RBOCs, or regional Bell operating companies), would be permitted to \n",
      "offer long-distance service in exchange for letting the long-distance \n",
      "companies and smaller new phone companies use their lines to compete for \n",
      "customers. Consumers would win, because for the first time they would \n",
      "get the benefits of competition in local service while getting even more \n",
      "competition than they already had in long distance. But the politics and \n",
      "economics of the Telecom Act (which was shepherded through Congress by \n",
      "Vice-President Gore) were just as important. Democrats saw the act as \n",
      "helping to reposition them as the technology party—the party that \n",
      "brought the Internet into every home, created hundreds of thousands of \n",
      "jobs in new companies, and, not least, set off an investment boom whose \n",
      "beneficiaries might become the party's new contributor base. Clinton's \n",
      "slogans about the \"information superhighway\" and \"building a bridge to \n",
      "the twenty-first century,\" which, like all Clinton slogans, artfully \n",
      "sent different messages to different constituencies, were the rhetorical \n",
      "correlates of the Telecom Act, and Gore's cruise to the Presidency was \n",
      "supposed to be powered substantially by the act's success.\n",
      "\n",
      "The F.C.C. had a crucial role in all this. The arbocks are rich, \n",
      "aggressive, politically powerful, and generally Republican (though like \n",
      "all important interest groups they work with both parties); they \n",
      "immediately filed lawsuits, which wound up tying the hands of their new \n",
      "competitors in the local phone market for more than three years. Through \n",
      "rule-making, enforcement, and litigation, the F.C.C., then headed by \n",
      "Reed Hundt, who was Gore's classmate at St. Albans, was supposed to keep \n",
      "the arbocks in their cages, so that not only long-distance companies \n",
      "like A.T. & T. and MCI WorldCom but also a whole category of new \n",
      "companies, \"see-lecks\" (the pronounced version of CLECs, or competitive \n",
      "local exchange carriers), could emerge. This entailed the regulatory \n",
      "equivalent of hand-to-hand combat: the see-leck is supposed to have \n",
      "access to the arbock's switching equipment, the arbock won't give the \n",
      "seeleck a key to the room where it's kept, so the see-leck asks the \n",
      "F.C.C. to rule that the arbock has to give it the key.\n",
      "\n",
      "Partly because Hundt assured the see-lecks and other new companies that \n",
      "he would protect them, and partly because of the generally booming \n",
      "condition of the economy then, investment capital flooded into the \n",
      "see-lecks—companies with names like Winstar, Covad, and Teligent—and \n",
      "into other telecommunications companies. Even not obviously related \n",
      "technology companies like Cisco Systems benefitted from the telecom \n",
      "boom: demand for their products was supposed to come from the see-lecks \n",
      "and other new players. There would be no conflict between the interests \n",
      "of the new telecom companies and those of consumers; as one of Hundt's \n",
      "former lieutenants told me, \"Reed used to joke that my job was to make \n",
      "sure that all prices went down and all stocks went up.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The years following the passage of the Telecom Act were the peak of the \n",
      "boom. Wall Street had its blood up, and that meant not just more \n",
      "startups but also more mergers of existing communications companies: \n",
      "Time Warner and AOL decided to throw in together, and A.T. & T. and \n",

      "They were not the only ones who were hysterical about the opportunities. \n",

      "\"But. We were sucking helium out of balloons, with the kinds of \n",

      "\n",
      "How could the Telecom Act have been handled better? \"We could have \n",
      "chosen policies that were less hellbent on a single objective, and were \n",

      "in it. And the problem is there is no short fix for this problem. This \n",

      "F.C.C.'s Accounting Safeguards Division, Powell announced that he was \n",
      "appointing a committee to study accounting standards in the \n",
      "communications industry. But that shows that Powell is better at riding \n",
      "out the storm than, say, Harvey Pitt, his counterpart at the Securities \n",

      "up the telecom industry.\n",

      "While acknowledging uncertainties about the long-term health effects of\n",

      "\n",
      "The report mirrors conclusions made previously in documents from various\n",

      "The engine rule does not affect emissions from trucks already on the road,\n",
      "although the separate regulation cutting the amount of sulfur in diesel fuel\n",
      "is expected to produce pollution reductions.\n",
      "\n",
      "The EPA's 651-page diesel health assessment did not attempt to estimate the\n",
      "probability of an individual getting cancer, given certain exposure to\n",
      "diesel exhaust. Such a risk assessment is commonly made by the EPA when\n",
      "gauging pollution health concerns.\n",

      "pursuit. \"When you think of people who were friends at\n",
      "Enron,\" she added, \"you can see how friendship can support\n",
      "antisocial behavior.\" \n",
      "\n",
      "Betrayal also makes for a bad friendship. \"When friends\n",
      "split up,\" said Dr. Keith E. Davis, a professor of\n",
      "psychology at the University of South Carolina, \"it is\n",
      "often in cases where one has shared personal information or\n",
      "secrets that the other one wanted to be kept confidential.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Another form of betrayal, Dr. Yager said, is when a friend\n",
      "suddenly turns cold, without ever explaining why. \"It's\n",
      "more than just pulling away,\" she said. \"The silent\n",
      "treatment is actually malicious.\" \n",
      "\n",
      "At least as devastating is an affair with the friend's\n",
      "romantic partner, as recently happened to one of Dr.\n",
      "Lerner's patients. \"I would not encourage her to hang in\n",
      "there and work this one out,\" Dr. Lerner said. \n",
      "\n",
      "A third type of bad friendship involves someone who insults\n",
      "the other person, Dr. Yager said. One of the 180 people who\n",
      "responded to Dr. Yager's most recent survey on friendship\n",
      "described how, when she was 11, her best friend called her\n",
      "\"a derogatory name.\" The woman, now 32, was so devastated\n",
      "that she feels she has been unable to be fully open with\n",
      "people ever since, Dr. Yager said. \n",
      "\n",
      "Emotional abuse may be less noticeable than verbal abuse,\n",
      "but it is \"more insidious,\" Dr. Yager said. \"Some people\n",
      "constantly set up their friends,\" she explained. \"They'll\n",
      "have a party, not invite the friend, but make sure he or\n",
      "she finds out.\" \n",
      "\n",
      "Risk takers, betrayers and abusers are the most extreme\n",
      "kinds of bad friends, Dr. Yager said, but they are not the\n",
      "only ones. She identifies 21 different varieties. Occupying\n",
      "the second tier of badness are the liar, the person who is\n",
      "overly dependent, the friend who never listens, the person\n",
      "who meddles too much in a friend's life, the competitor and\n",
      "the loner, who prefers not to spend time with friends. \n",
      "\n",
      "Most common is the promise breaker. \"This includes everyone\n",
      "from the person who says let's have a cup of coffee but\n",
      "something always comes up at the last minute to someone who\n",
      "promises to be there for you when you need them, but then\n",
      "isn't,\" Dr. Yager said. \n",
      "\n",
      "Some friendships go bad, as some romantic relationships do,\n",
      "when one of the people gradually or suddenly finds reasons\n",
      "to dislike the other one. \n",
      "\n",
      "\"With couples, it can take 18 to 24 months for someone to\n",
      "discover there's something important they don't like about\n",

      "\"One might find, for example, that in subtle ways the other\n",
      "person is a racist. In friendships, which are less intense,\n",
      "it may take even more time for one person to meet the\n",
      "other's dislike criteria.\" \n",
      "\n",
      "Whether a friendship is worth saving, Dr. Lerner said,\n",
      "\"depends on how large the injury is.\" \n",
      "\n",
      "\"Sometimes the mature thing is to lighten up and let\n",
      "something go,\" she added. \"It's also an act of maturity\n",
      "sometimes to accept another person's limitations.\" \n",
      "\n",
      "Acceptance should come easier among friends than among\n",
      "spouses, Dr. Lerner said, because people have more than one\n",
      "friend and do not need a full range of emotional support\n",
      "from each one. \n",
      "\n",
      "But if the friendship has deteriorated to the point where\n",
      "one friend truly dislikes the other one or finds that the\n",
      "friendship is causing undue stress, the healthy response is\n",
      "to pull away, Dr. Yager said, to stop sharing the personal\n",

      "easier to dissolve than marriage. But it is also\n",

      "6 a.m. and, at the same moment, another man was on the move: Mohammad \n",
      "Atta. Two hours later, as Mr. Bush drove to an elementary school, \n",
      "hijackers on four planes were murdering the flight crews and turning the \n",

      "\n",
      "“We’re at war and somebody has dared attack us and we’re going to do \n",
      "something about it,” Mr. Bush recalls. “I realized I was in a unique \n",

      "looking at these little children and all of the sudden we were at war. I \n",

      "\n",
      "Mr. Bush walked into a classroom set up with a secure phone. He called \n",
      "the vice president, pulling the phone cord tight as he spun to see the \n",

      "\"Ladies and gentlemen, this is a difficult moment for America,” he said \n",
      "in the speech. “Today, we’ve had a national tragedy.”\n",
      "\n",
      "It was 9:30 a.m. As he spoke, Mr. Bush didn’t know that two more \n",

      "Cheney was in his office at the White House when a Secret Service agent \n",
      "ran in.\n",
      "\n",
      "“He said to me, ‘Sir, we have to leave immediately’ and grabbed, put a \n",
      "hand on my belt, another hand on my shoulder and propelled me out the \n",
      "door of my office,” Cheney recalls. “I’m not sure how they do it, but \n",
      "they sort of levitate you down the hallway, you move very fast.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“There wasn’t a lot of time for chitchat, you know, with the vice \n",

      "\n",
      "Cheney was rushed deep under the White House into a bunker called the \n",
      "Presidential Emergency Operations Center. It was built for war, and this \n",
      "was it. On her way down, National Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice \n",
      "called Mr. Bush.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It was brief because I was being pushed to get off the phone and get \n",

      "with the president and I just said, he said, ‘I’m coming back’ and we \n",
      "said ‘Mr. President that may not be wise.’ I remember stopping briefly \n",
      "to call my family, my aunt and uncle in Alabama and say, ‘I’m fine. You \n",
      "have to tell everybody that I’m fine’ but then settling into trying to \n",
      "deal with the enormity of that moment, and in the first few hours, I \n",

      "are coming.”\n",

      "The Capitol was evacuated. And for the first time ever, the Secret \n",
      "Service executed the emergency plan to ensure the presidential line of \n",

      "\n",
      "“It’s important to emphasize it's not personal, you don’t think of it in \n",

      "As the Pentagon burned, Mr. Bush’s limousine sped toward Air Force One \n",

      "\n",
      "Tillman asked for an armed guard at his cockpit door while Secret \n",

      "telephone.\n",
      "\n",
      "“We actually didn't tell them our destination or what directions we were \n",
      "heading,” says Tillman. “We, we basically just talked to 'em and said, \n",

      "\n",
      "The men in the F-16s were Shane Brotherton and Randy Roberts, from the \n",
      "Texas Air National Guard. Their mission was so secret their commander \n",

      "\n",
      "We now know that the threat to Air Force One was part of the fog of war, \n",
      "a false alarm. But it had a powerful effect at the time. Some wondered, \n",
      "with the president out of sight, was he still running the government? He \n",
      "hadn’t appeared after the attack on Washington. Mr. Bush was clearly \n",
      "worried about it. At one point he was overheard saying, “The American \n",
      "people want to know where their dang president is.” The staff considered \n",
      "an address to the nation by phone but instead Mr. Bush ordered Air Force \n",
      "One to land somewhere within 30 minutes so he could appear on TV. At \n",
      "11:45 a.m., they landed at Barksdale Air Force Base in Louisiana.\n",

      "“The resolve of our great nation is being tested. But make no mistake, \n",

      "\n",
      "At Barksdale, the Secret Service believed the situation in Washington \n",
      "was still unsafe. So the plane continued on to Nebraska, to the command \n",
      "center where Mr. Bush would be secure and have all the communications \n",
      "gear he needed to run the government. Aboard Air Force One, Mr. Bush had \n",
      "a job for press secretary Fleischer.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The president asked me to make sure that I took down everything that \n",
      "was said. I think he wanted to make certain that a record existed,” says \n",
      "Fleischer\n",
      "\n",
      "Fleischer’s notes capture Mr. Bush’s language, plain and unguarded. To \n",
      "the vice president he said: “We’re at war, Dick, we’re going to find out \n",
      "who did this and kick their ass.” Another time, Mr. Bush said, “We’re \n",
      "not going to have any slap-on-the-wrist crap this time.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The President adds, “I can remember telling the Secretary of Defense, I \n",
      "said, ‘We’re going to find out who did this and then Mr. Secretary, you \n",
      "and Dick Myers,’ who we just named as chairman of the joint chiefs, ‘are \n",
      "going to go get them.’”\n",
      "\n",
      "By 3 p.m., Air Force One touched down at Offutt Air Force Base in \n",
      "Nebraska. Mr. Bush and his team were herded into a small brick hut that \n",
      "gave no hint of what they would find below.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the bottom of the stairs was the U.S. Strategic Command Underground \n",
      "Command Center. It was built to transmit a president’s order to go to \n",
      "nuclear war. But when Mr. Bush walked in, the battle staff was watching \n",
      "the skies over the United States. Many airplanes had still not landed. \n",
      "After a short briefing, Mr. Bush and Card were taken to a teleconference \n",
      "center which connected them to the White House, the Pentagon, the FBI \n",
      "and the CIA. Mr. Bush had a question for his CIA Director George Tenent.\n",
      "\n",
      "According to Rice, Bush asked Tenent who had done this. Rice recalls \n",
      "that Tenent answered: “Sir, I believe its al Qaeda. We’re doing the \n",
      "assessment but it looks like, it feels like, it smells like al Qaeda.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The evidence would build. FBI Director Robert Mueller says that an \n",
      "essential clue came from one of the hijacked planes before it crashed.\n",
      "\n",
      "A flight attendant on American Flight 11, Amy Sweeney, had the presence \n",
      "of mind to call her office as the plane was hijacked and give them the \n",
      "seat numbers of the hijackers. “That was the first piece of hard \n",
      "evidence. We could then go to the manifest, find out who was sitting in \n",
      "those seats and immediately conduct an investigation of those \n",
      "individuals, as opposed to taking all the passengers on the plane and \n",
      "going through a process of elimination,” says Mueller.\n",
      "\n",
      "In Nebraska, the White House staff was preparing for an address to the \n",
      "nation from the Air Force bunker, but by then the president had had \n",
      "enough. He decided to come back.\n",
      "\n",
      "“At one point, he said he didn’t want any tinhorn terrorist keeping him \n",
      "out of Washington,” Fleischer says. “That verbatim.”\n",
      "\n",
      "On board, he was already thinking of issuing an ultimatum to the world: \n",
      "“I had time to think and a couple of thoughts emerged. One was that \n",
      "you're guilty if you harbor a terrorist, because I knew these terrorists \n",
      "like al-Qaeda liked to prey on weak government and weak people. The \n",
      "other thought that came was the opportunity to fashion a vast coalition \n",
      "of countries that would either be with us or with the terrorists.”\n",
      "\n",
      "As Air Force One sped east, the last casualty of the attack on America \n",
      "collapsed, one of the nation’s worst days wore into evening. At the \n",
      "World Trade Center, 2,801 were killed; at the Pentagon, 184; and in \n",
      "Pennsylvania 40. Altogether, there were 3,025 dead.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Anybody who would attack America the way they did, anybody who would \n",
      "take innocent life the way they did, anybody who's so devious, is evil,” \n",
      "Bush said recently.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Bush would soon see that evil face to face. After arriving in \n",
      "Washington, he boarded his helicopter and flew past the Pentagon on the \n",
      "way to the White House.\n",
      "\n",
      "Was there a time when he was afraid that there might not be a White \n",
      "House to return to? “I don’t remember thinking about whether or not the \n",
      "White House would have been obliterated,\" he recalls. \"I think I might \n",
      "have thought they took their best shot, and now it was time for us to \n",
      "take our best shot.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Bush arrived back at the White House nine hours after the attacks. \n",
      "His next step was an address to the nation. Karen Hughes and her staff \n",
      "were already working on the speech.\n",
      "\n",
      "“He decided that the primary tone he wanted to strike that night was \n",
      "reassurance,” remembers Hughes. “We had to show resolve, we had to \n",
      "reassure people, we had to let them know that we would be OK.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Just off the Oval Office, Mr. Bush added the words that would become \n",
      "known as the Bush Doctrine - no distinction between terrorists and those \n",
      "who harbor them. The staff wanted to add a declaration of war but Mr. \n",
      "Bush didn’t think the American people wanted to hear it that night and \n",
      "he was emphatic about that.\n",
      "\n",
      "He prepared to say it from the same desk where Franklin Roosevelt first \n",
      "heard the news of Pearl Harbor. Now Bush was commander in chief. Eighty \n",
      "million Americans were watching.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Today our fellow citizens, our way of life, our very freedom came under \n",
      "attack in a series of deliberate and deadly terrorist acts,” he said \n",
      "from the Oval Office that night.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Oval Office speech came at the end of the bloodiest day in American \n",
      "history since the Civil War. Before he walked to the White House \n",
      "residence for the night, Mr. Bush dictated these words for the White \n",
      "House daily log: “The Pearl Harbor of the 21st century took place today. \n",
      "We think it's Osama bin Laden.”\n",
      "\n",
      "(CBS) When Sept. 12 dawned, President Bush was demanding a war plan. No \n",
      "one in the White House or the Pentagon could be sure of what the \n",
      "president would do. In office for just eight months, he’d never been \n",
      "tested as commander-in-chief.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I never asked them what they thought,” President Bush said of the \n",
      "Pentagon brass, “because I didn’t really – because I knew what I was \n",
      "gonna do. I knew exactly what had to be done, Scott. And that was to set \n",
      "a strategy to seek justice. Find out who did it, hunt them down and \n",
      "bring them to justice.”\n",
      "\n",
      "In the cabinet room, the president made clear what was next: “The \n",
      "deliberate and deadly attacks which were carried out yesterday against \n",
      "our country were more than acts of terror, they were acts of war,” he \n",
      "said.\n",
      "\n",
      "To the war cabinet, al Qaeda was no surprise. National Security Advisor \n",

      "strategy to eliminate these guys,’” Rice recalls.\n",
      "\n",
      "In one of the worst intelligence failures ever, the CIA and FBI didn’t \n",
      "pick up clues that an attack in the United States was imminent. Without \n",
      "a sense of urgency, the White House strategy the president had asked for \n",
      "came too late.\n",
      "\n",
      "Chief of Staff Andrew Card recalls that the plan Mr. Bush had asked for \n",
      "was “literally headed to the president’s desk, I think, on the eleventh, \n",
      "tenth or eleventh, of September.”\n",
      "\n",
      "On Sept. 12, the war cabinet was debating the full range of options - \n",
      "who to hit and how to hit them. There were some at the Pentagon who \n",
      "worried in the early hours that Mr. Bush would order up an immediate \n",

      "the past.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, there’s a lot of nervous Nellies at the Pentagon, anyway,” Mr. \n",

      "(Donald) Rumsfeld early on discussed the idea of making sure we had what \n",

      "The president says he wanted to “fight and win a guerilla war with \n",
      "conventional means.”\n",
      "\n",
      "It was an innovative but risky idea being proposed by CIA Director \n",

      "Taliban government.\n",

      "“As I like to describe it to my friends,” Powell says, “we had on the \n",

      "best in the world. How do you connect it all?”\n",
      "\n",

      "world.” Now one-fifth of it was in ruins. The wreckage of American \n",
      "Flight 77 was being examined by Navy investigators. And before Mr. Bush \n",

      "the remains of the first casualties of war on his watch.\n",
      "The next day, Sept. 13, there was another warning of attack that the \n",
      "public never heard about. Threats had been were coming in constantly but \n",
      "this one sounded credible: a large truck bomb headed to the White House. \n",

      "Mr. Bush had been in New York just a few weeks before; he’d posed with \n",

      "When the president arrived Sept. 14, Manhattan was papered with the \n",
      "faces of the lost. Families, unable to believe that so many had vanished \n",

      "survive underneath the rubble and we’ll get him out.’ I, on the other \n",
      "hand had been briefed about the realities, and my job was to hug and \n",

      "because the loved ones won’t come out.’”\n",
      "\n",
      "One little boy handed the president a picture of his father in his \n",

      "\n",
      "It was an effort “to provide a little hope,” the president recalls. “I \n",

      "who loved their dads or loved their mom, or loved their…wives who loved \n",
      "their husbands. It was a tough time, you know, it was a tough time for \n",
      "all of us because we were a very emotional, and I was emotional at \n",
      "times. I felt, I felt the same now as I did then, which is sad. And I \n",
      "still feel sad for those who grieve for their families, but through my \n",
      "tears, I see opportunity.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The president was supposed to be with the families for about 30 minutes; \n",
      "he stayed for two and a half hours. It was there he met Arlene Howard. \n",

      "zero.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I called the police department,” Howard remembers, “ and they said he \n",
      "hadn’t called in for roll call and to call back in an hour and I said, \n",
      "‘No, I don’t need to call back.’ If he hadn’t called in, I knew where he \n",

      "George Howard had rescued children trapped in an elevator back in 1993 \n",
      "when the World Trade Center was bombed. He had been off duty that day, \n",
      "and he was off duty on Sept. 11, but couldn’t stay away. The police \n",
      "department gave his badge to his mother and she gave it to the president.\n",
      "\n",
      "“He (the president) he leaned over to talk to me,” Howard recalls. “And \n",

      "United States will do what it takes,” Mr. Bush told them.\n",
      "\n",
      "As Powell remembers it, “He was encouraging us to think boldly. He was \n",
      "listening to all ideas; he was not constrained to any one idea; he \n",
      "wanted to hear his advisors talk and argue and debate with each other.”\n",
      "\n",
      "President Bush was pleased with the progress that had been made. “On the \n",

      "cabinet what he was planning.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I wanted to just think it through,” Mr. Bush remembers. “Any time you \n",

      "happened,” Mr. Bush told the Congress and the nation. “We’ll remember \n",
      "the moment the news came, where we were and what we were doing. Some \n",
      "will remember an image of a fire or a story of rescue. Some will carry \n",
      "memories of a face and a voice gone forever. And I will carry this. It \n",

      "Trade Center trying to save others. It was given to me by his mom, \n",

      "at the same time, hopefully lay the seeds for, the conditions necessary \n",

      "Certainly, we’ve overthrown the Taliban government. Certainly, al Qaeda \n",

      "  SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Computer maker Sun Microsystems Inc. on Thursday\n",
      "  said it would create in a few years a network environment that will be as\n",
      "  straightforward to handle as a single machine, a strategy it calls N1.\n",
      "\n",
      "  It laid out a road map for a new layer of intelligent software and systems that will meld\n",
      "  unwieldy networks into easy-to-use systems, a goal similar to those of most rivals\n",
      "  making computers which manage networks. \n",
      "  EMC Corp. announced this week software aimed at allowing users to manage storage\n",
      "  resources as a pool. Hewlett-Packard Co has a Utility Data Center, designed for\n",
      "  broader management. International Business Machines Corp's project eLiza is working\n",
      "  to make computers \"self-healing\" when systems break.\n",
      "\n",
      "  \"Applications still have to run zeroes and ones on some computing engine but the\n",
      "  whole idea behind N1 is you stop thinking about that. You don't think about what box\n",
      "  it is running on,\" Sun Vice President Steve MacKay, head of the N1 program, said in an\n",
      "  interview on the sidelines of a Sun user conference. \n",
      "\n",
      "  Many industry executives see computer power eventually being sold like power or\n",
      "  water, as a utility that can be turned on or off, in whatever volume one wants whenever\n",
      "  needed. \n",
      "  For that to happen computers must be tied together seamlessly, rather than cobbling\n",
      "  them together with tenuous links, as most networks do today, experts say. There are\n",
      "  still major barriers, though, such as communications standards for machines from\n",
      "  different vendors to interoperate closely. \n",
      "  Sun promised to deliver a \"virtualization engine\" that would let administrators look at\n",
      "  their entire network as a pool by the end of the year. Network administrators today\n",
      "  often have no automatic system to report what is in the network. \n",
      "\n",
      "  \"It'll tell you what you have and how it is laid out,\" promised MacKay\n",
      "  The second stage, beginning in 2003, would allow users to identify a service, such as\n",
      "  online banking, and allocate resources for them with a few clicks, Sun said. \n",
      "  Finally, in 2004, Sun's software should allow networks to change uses of resources on\n",

      "INTRODUCTION\n",
      "\n",
      "THE great struggles of the twentieth century between liberty and \n",
      "totalitarianism ended with a decisive victory for the forces of \n",
      "freedom -- and a single sustainable model for national success: freedom, \n",
      "democracy, and free enterprise. In the twenty-first century, only \n",
      "nations that share a commitment to protecting basic human rights and \n",
      "guaranteeing political and economic freedom will be able to unleash the \n",
      "potential of their people and assure their future prosperity. People \n",
      "everywhere want to say what they think; choose who will govern them; \n",
      "worship as they please; educate their children -- male and female; own \n",
      "property; and enjoy the benefits of their labor. These values of freedom \n",
      "are right and true for every person, in every society -- and the duty of \n",
      "protecting these values against their enemies is the common calling of \n",
      "freedom-loving people across the globe and across the ages.\n",
      "\n",
      "Today, the United States enjoys a position of unparalleled military \n",
      "strength and great economic and political influence. In keeping with our \n",
      "heritage and principles, we do not use our strength to press for \n",
      "unilateral advantage. We seek instead to create a balance of power that \n",
      "favors human freedom: conditions in which all nations and all societies \n",
      "can choose for themselves the rewards and challenges of political and \n",
      "economic liberty. By making the world safer, we allow the people of the \n",
      "world to make their own lives better. We will defend this just peace \n",
      "against threats from terrorists and tyrants. We will preserve the peace \n",
      "by building good relations among the great powers. We will extend the \n",
      "peace by encouraging free and open societies on every continent.\n",
      "\n",
      "Defending our Nation against its enemies is the first and fundamental \n",
      "commitment of the Federal Government. Today, that task has changed \n",
      "dramatically. Enemies in the past needed great armies and great \n",
      "industrial capabilities to endanger America. Now, shadowy networks of \n",
      "individuals can bring great chaos and suffering to our shores for less \n",
      "than it costs to purchase a single tank. Terrorists are organized to \n",
      "penetrate open societies and to turn the power of modern technologies \n",
      "against us.\n",
      "\n",
      "To defeat this threat we must make use of every tool in our arsenal -- \n",
      "from better homeland defenses and law enforcement to intelligence and \n",
      "cutting off terrorist financing. The war against terrorists of global \n",
      "reach is a global enterprise of uncertain duration. America will help \n",
      "nations that need our assistance in combating terror. And America will \n",
      "hold to account nations that are compromised by terror -- because the \n",
      "allies of terror are the enemies of civilization. The United States and \n",
      "countries cooperating with us must not allow the terrorists to develop \n",
      "new home bases. Together, we will seek to deny them sanctuary at every \n",
      "turn.\n",
      "\n",
      "The gravest danger our Nation faces lies at the crossroads of radicalism \n",
      "and technology. Our enemies have openly declared that they are seeking \n",
      "weapons of mass destruction, and evidence indicates that they are doing \n",
      "so with determination. The United States will not allow these efforts to \n",
      "succeed. We will build defenses against ballistic missiles and other \n",
      "means of delivery. We will cooperate with other nations to deny, \n",
      "contain, and curtail our enemies' efforts to acquire dangerous \n",
      "technologies. And, as a matter of common sense and self-defense, America \n",
      "will act against such emerging threats before they are fully formed. We \n",
      "cannot defend America and our friends by hoping for the best. So we must \n",
      "be prepared to defeat our enemies' plans, using the best intelligence \n",
      "and proceeding with deliberation. History will judge harshly those who \n",
      "saw this coming danger but failed to act. In the new world we have \n",
      "entered, the only path to safety is the path of action.\n",
      "\n",
      "As we defend the peace, we will also take advantage of an historic \n",
      "opportunity to preserve the peace. Today, the international community \n",
      "has the best chance since the rise of the nation-state in the \n",
      "seventeenth century to build a world where great powers compete in peace \n",
      "instead of continually prepare for war. Today, the world's great powers \n",
      "find ourselves on the same side -- united by common dangers of terrorist \n",
      "violence and chaos. The United States will build on these common \n",
      "interests to promote global security. We are also increasingly united by \n",
      "common values. Russia is in the midst of a hopeful transition, reaching \n",
      "for its democratic future and a partner in the war on terror. Chinese \n",
      "leaders are discovering that economic freedom is the only source of \n",
      "national wealth. In time, they will find that social and political \n",
      "freedom is the only source of national greatness. America will encourage \n",
      "the advancement of democracy and economic openness in both nations, \n",
      "because these are the best foundations for domestic stability and \n",

      "the hope of democracy, development, free markets, and free trade to \n",
      "every corner of the world. The events of September 11, 2001, taught us \n",
      "that weak states, like Afghanistan, can pose as great a danger to our \n",
      "national interests as strong states. Poverty does not make poor people \n",
      "into terrorists and murderers. Yet poverty, weak institutions, and \n",
      "corruption can make weak states vulnerable to terrorist networks and \n",
      "drug cartels within their borders.\n",
      "\n",
      "The United States will stand beside any nation determined to build a \n",
      "better future by seeking the rewards of liberty for its people. Free \n",

      "out of poverty -- so the United States will work with individual \n",

      "AIDS and other infectious diseases.\n",
      "\n",
      "In building a balance of power that favors freedom, the United States is \n",
      "guided by the conviction that all nations have important \n",
      "responsibilities. Nations that enjoy freedom must actively fight terror. \n",
      "Nations that depend on international stability must help prevent the \n",
      "spread of weapons of mass destruction. Nations that seek international \n",
      "aid must govern themselves wisely, so that aid is well spent. For \n",
      "freedom to thrive, accountability must be expected and required.\n",
      "\n",
      "We are also guided by the conviction that no nation can build a safer, \n",
      "better world alone. Alliances and multilateral institutions can multiply \n",
      "the strength of freedom-loving nations. The United States is committed \n",
      "to lasting institutions like the United Nations, the World Trade \n",
      "Organization, the Organization of American States, and NATO as well as \n",
      "other long-standing alliances. Coalitions of the willing can augment \n",
      "these permanent institutions. In all cases, international obligations \n",
      "are to be taken seriously. They are not to be undertaken symbolically to \n",
      "rally support for an ideal without furthering its attainment.\n",
      "\n",
      "Freedom is the non-negotiable demand of human dignity; the birthright of \n",

      "> THE great struggles of the twentieth century between liberty and\n",

      "> freedom -- and a single sustainable model for national success: freedom,\n",
      "> democracy, and free enterprise. In the twenty-first century, only\n",
      "> nations that share a commitment to protecting basic human rights and\n",
      "> guaranteeing political and economic freedom will be able to unleash the\n",
      "> potential of their people and assure their future prosperity. People\n",
      "> everywhere want to say what they think; choose who will govern them;\n",
      "> worship as they please; educate their children -- male and female; own\n",
      "> property; and enjoy the benefits of their labor. These values of freedom\n",
      "> are right and true for every person, in every society -- and the duty of\n",
      "> protecting these values against their enemies is the common calling of\n",
      "> freedom-loving people across the globe and across the ages.\n",
      ">\n",
      "> Today, the United States enjoys a position of unparalleled military\n",
      "> strength and great economic and political influence. In keeping with our\n",
      "> heritage and principles, we do not use our strength to press for\n",
      "> unilateral advantage. We seek instead to create a balance of power that\n",
      "> favors human freedom: conditions in which all nations and all societies\n",
      "> can choose for themselves the rewards and challenges of political and\n",
      "> economic liberty. By making the world safer, we allow the people of the\n",
      "> world to make their own lives better. We will defend this just peace\n",
      "> against threats from terrorists and tyrants. We will preserve the peace\n",
      "> by building good relations among the great powers. We will extend the\n",
      "> peace by encouraging free and open societies on every continent.\n",
      ">\n",
      "> Defending our Nation against its enemies is the first and fundamental\n",
      "> commitment of the Federal Government. Today, that task has changed\n",
      "> dramatically. Enemies in the past needed great armies and great\n",
      "> industrial capabilities to endanger America. Now, shadowy networks of\n",
      "> individuals can bring great chaos and suffering to our shores for less\n",
      "> than it costs to purchase a single tank. Terrorists are organized to\n",
      "> penetrate open societies and to turn the power of modern technologies\n",
      "> against us.\n",
      ">\n",
      "> To defeat this threat we must make use of every tool in our arsenal --\n",
      "> from better homeland defenses and law enforcement to intelligence and\n",
      "> cutting off terrorist financing. The war against terrorists of global\n",
      "> reach is a global enterprise of uncertain duration. America will help\n",
      "> nations that need our assistance in combating terror. And America will\n",
      "> hold to account nations that are compromised by terror -- because the\n",
      "> allies of terror are the enemies of civilization. The United States and\n",
      "> countries cooperating with us must not allow the terrorists to develop\n",
      "> new home bases. Together, we will seek to deny them sanctuary at every\n",
      "> turn.\n",
      ">\n",
      "> The gravest danger our Nation faces lies at the crossroads of radicalism\n",
      "> and technology. Our enemies have openly declared that they are seeking\n",
      "> weapons of mass destruction, and evidence indicates that they are doing\n",
      "> so with determination. The United States will not allow these efforts to\n",
      "> succeed. We will build defenses against ballistic missiles and other\n",

      "> will act against such emerging threats before they are fully formed. We\n",
      "> cannot defend America and our friends by hoping for the best. So we must\n",

      "> * Insist upon measurable results to ensure that development\n",

      "> progress so that a focus on results is an integral part of everything\n",
      "> that these institutions do.\n",
      ">\n",
      "> * Increase the amount of development assistance that is provided in\n",
      "> the form of grants instead of loans. Greater use of results-based grants\n",
      "> is the best way to help poor countries make productive investments,\n",
      "> particularly in the social sectors, without saddling them with\n",
      "> ever-larger debt burdens. As a result of U.S. leadership, the recent IDA\n",
      "> agreement provided for significant increases in grant funding for the\n",

      "> sanitation, and other human needs. Our goal is to build on that progress\n",
      "> by increasing the use of grants at the other multilateral development\n",

      "> sector to match government efforts by using grants to support\n",
      "> development projects that show results.\n",
      ">\n",
      "> * Open societies to commerce and investment. Trade and investment are\n",
      "> the real engines of economic growth. Even if government aid increases,\n",
      "> most money for development must come from trade, domestic capital, and\n",
      "> foreign investment. An effective strategy must try to expand these flows\n",

      ">\n",
      "> * Secure public health. The scale of the public health crisis in poor\n",

      "> developed world are necessary but will be effective only with honest\n",
      "> governance, which supports prevention programs and provides effective\n",

      "> and its focus on combining prevention with a broad strategy for\n",

      ">\n",
      "> * Emphasize education. Literacy and learning are the foundation of\n",

      "> will increase its own funding for education assistance by at least 20\n",

      "SUMMARY\n",
      "\n",
      "As part of an ongoing NASA/UAH joint project, Dr. John Christy of UAH and Dr. Roy Spencer of NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center use data gathered by microwave sounding units (MSUs) on National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration TIROS-N satellites to get accurate, direct measurements of atmospheric temperatures for almost all regions of the Earth, including remote deserts, rain forests and oceans for which reliable temperature data are not otherwise available.\n",
      "\n",
      "The accuracy and reliability of temperature data gathered by the satellites since January 1979 has been confirmed by comparing the satellite data to independent temperature data. A recent study (1) found a 97 percent agreement between the MSU data and temperatures measured by thermometers suspended beneath weather balloons released by meteorologists for weather observations.\n",
      "\n",
      "Once the monthly temperature data is collected from the satellites and processed, it is placed in a \"public\" computer file for immediate access by atmospheric scientists in the U.S. and abroad. It has become the basis for a number of major studies in global climate change, and is cited in reports from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "GATHERING THE DATA\n",
      "\n",
      "While traditional thermometers measure the temperature at a specific point in the air, a microwave sounding unit on a satellite takes readings that are average temperatures in a huge volume of the atmosphere. Each of the more than 30,000 readings per day per satellite is an average temperature for more than 75,000 cubic kilometers of air.\n",
      "\n",
      "The MSU makes a direct measurement of the temperature by looking at microwaves emitted by oxygen molecules in the atmosphere. The intensity of the microwave emissions - their \"brightness\" - varies according to temperature.\n",
      "\n",
      "Christy and Spencer developed a method to take the data from several satellites and produce a unified temperature dataset.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "VERIFYING THE ACCURACY OF MSU MEASUREMENTS\n",
      "\n",
      "A recent comparison (1) of temperature readings from two major climate monitoring systems - microwave sounding units on satellites and thermometers suspended below helium balloons - found a \"remarkable\" level of agreement between the two.\n",
      "\n",
      "To verify the accuracy of temperature data collected by microwave sounding units, Christy compared temperature readings recorded by \"radiosonde\" thermometers to temperatures reported by the satellites as they orbited over the balloon launch sites.\n",
      "\n",
      "He found a 97 percent correlation over the 16-year period of the study. The overall composite temperature trends at those sites agreed to within 0.03 degrees Celsius (about 0.054° Fahrenheit) per decade. The same results were found when considering only stations in the polar or arctic regions.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The idea was to determine the reliability of the satellite data by comparing it to an established independent measurement,\" Christy said. \"If satellite data are reliable when the satellites are over the radiosonde sites, that means you should be able to trust them everywhere else.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The 99 radiosondes reported an aggregate warming trend of 0.155 degrees Celsius (about 0.28° Fahrenheit) per decade since 1979. Over those 99 spots on the globe, the satellites also recorded a warming trend: 0.128 degrees Celsius (about 0.23° Fahrenheit) per decade.\n",
      "\n",
      "Globally, however, the satellite data show a cooling trend of 0.03 degrees Celsius per decade since the first NOAA TIROS-N satellites went into service.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"These 99 radiosonde launch sites are just not distributed evenly around the planet,\" Christy said. \"They are not representative of the total globe.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Radiosonde balloons are released from stations around the world, usually at noon and midnight Greenwich standard time. As each balloon climbs from the surface to the stratosphere, the temperature is measured and relayed to the ground by radio.\n",
      "\n",
      "While there are more than 1,000 radiosonde launch sites globally, the data from many sites either are not readily available or are not consistently collected. Christy used data from 99 sites at which there has been long-term systematic and reliable data collection. These 99 radiosonde launch sites are in a box bounded by Iceland, Trinidad, Truk Island and Alaska.\n",
      "\n",
      "In an earlier study, an upper air temperature record compiled by NOAA from 63 daily weather balloon sites around the world indicated a 17-year climate trend of -0.05° C per decade, which was in exact agreement with the satellite data at that time, Christy said.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "GLOBAL COVERAGE\n",
      "\n",
      "One advantage of the MSU dataset is its global coverage. Microwave sounding units aboard NOAA satellites directly measure the temperature of the atmosphere over more than 95 percent of the globe. Each satellite measures the temperature above most points on Earth every 12 hours.\n",
      "\n",
      "The 'global temperature' that has been frequently reported from surface measurements is neither global in extent nor systematic in measurement method. It neglects vast oceanic and continental regions, including Antarctica, the Brazilian rain forests, the Sahara Desert and Greenland.\n",
      "\n",
      "The most commonly cited historical temperature dataset is from ground-based thermometers. More than 5,000 thermometers worldwide provide almost instantaneous local temperature data through links to weather services and scientists.\n",
      "\n",
      "Most of these thermometers, which are usually in small shelters about five feet above the ground, are in areas easily accessible to people. In the U.S. and other industrial countries, these thermometers are most often found at airports.\n",
      "\n",
      "The ground-based network is extensive in North America, Europe, Russia, China and Japan. It is less comprehensive in Africa, South America, Australia and across much of Southern Asia.\n",
      "\n",
      "Temperatures on the surface and vertically through the atmosphere are gathered daily by thermometers carried aloft by helium balloons. \"Radiosonde\" balloons are released from stations around the world, usually at noon and midnight Greenwich standard time.\n",
      "\n",
      "While balloon release sites are scattered throughout the world, they are concentrated in industrial nations. There are more than 1,000 radiosonde launch sites globally. If they were evenly distributed around the world, that would equal approximately one for every 195,000 square miles of the Earth's surface.\n",
      "\n",
      "Water temperatures, which are used to derive estimates of atmospheric temperatures, come from thermometers on piers and buoys, and aboard \"ships of opportunity.\" The ships record the temperature of water drawn in to cool their engines. The water temperature data from these instruments is also not global in its coverage, tending instead to be concentrated in heavily-travelled shipping lanes, and in harbors.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the past 12 years, a new system of approximately 100 deep ocean buoys has been established, gathering both atmospheric and water temperature data.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "INSTRUMENT ACCURACY; MSU\n",
      "\n",
      "With nine satellites measuring the temperature over periods of from one to six years, a method was devised to merge all the data into a single, consistent time series.\n",
      "\n",
      "Each satellite has its own bias that, if not calculated and removed, would introduce spurious trends. The biases are calculated by directly comparing each satellite with others in operation at that time. Periods of overlapping operation ranged from three months to three years, and were sufficient to determine these biases.\n",
      "\n",
      "Because the MSU instruments are so stable and have so many thousands of observations, the biases between the satellites are known to within 0.01 deg. The final product removes these biases so that all data are referenced to a common base. (2)\n",
      "\n",
      "To check the final product, comparisons were made over a 16-year period with balloon measurements as stated above, and the phenomenal agreement provided the independent validation necessary to conclude that the merging technique developed for this dataset was accurate.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "INSTRUMENT ACCURACY; GROUND-BASED THERMOMETERS\n",
      "\n",
      "Of great concern to scientists is the lack of consistency in the way readings are taken and in the thermometer surroundings. Since most thermometers for which long-term records exist are in towns and cities, the effects of population growth and the construction of nearby roads, parking lots, runways and buildings may cause the temperature to rise a little due of urbanization. This temperature change may be an artifact of a local \"asphalt effect\" rather than a long-term widespread climate change.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "INSTRUMENT ACCURACY; SHIPS OF OPPORTUNITY\n",
      "\n",
      "While the temperature data collected by ships at sea is reported as a sea surface temperature, this data reflects water temperatures from about three to 60 feet below the surface - the level from which water is drawn into the ships.\n",
      "\n",
      "The thousands of individual thermometers used to collect this data are not calibrated against a scientific standard, nor is there a method for verifying the accuracy of either the thermometers or the reports matching temperature readings to specific times and places.\n",
      "\n",
      "Only in places where there are many overlapping observations can there be any confidence in their accuracy.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",

      "Earlier this month, we New Yorkers observed the solemn anniversary of the\n",
      "horrific events that befell our city on Sept. 11, 2001. All of those who\n",
      "perished must never be forgotten. The footprints of the fallen Twin Towers\n",
      "and a portion of the 16-acre site must be dedicated to a memorial and civic\n",
      "amenities that recall the sacrifices that were made there and the anguish\n",
      "that those senseless acts of terror created for the victims' families and,\n",
      "indeed, for all of us.\n",
      "\n",
      "But for the good of the city and the region, the 10-million-plus square\n",
      "feet of commercial and retail space that was destroyed with the Twin Towers\n",
      "must be replaced on the site.\n",
      "\n",
      "About 50,000 people worked in the World Trade Center. Those jobs are lost,\n",
      "along with those of another 50,000 people who worked in the vicinity.\n",
      "Together, those jobs in lower Manhattan, for which the Trade Center was the\n",
      "economic stimulus, produced annual gross wages of about $47 billion, or 15%\n",
      "of the annual gross wages earned in the entire state. Some of the firms\n",
      "have relocated elsewhere in the city and region, but many have not. New\n",
      "York City is facing a budget deficit. Without additional jobs, the deficit\n",
      "may become permanent. This is one reason for the importance of rebuilding.\n",
      "\n",
      "If we do not replace the lost space, lower Manhattan never will regain the\n",
      "vibrancy it had as the world's financial center. Love them or hate them,\n",
      "and there were lots of New Yorkers on both sides of the issue, the Towers\n",
      "made a powerful statement to the world that said, \"This is New York, a\n",
      "symbol of our free economy and of our way of life.\" That is why they were\n",
      "destroyed. This is a second reason why the towers must be replaced, and\n",
      "with buildings that make a potent architectural statement.\n",
      "\n",
      "In recent weeks, redevelopment proposals have been circulated from many\n",
      "sources. Most of these focus not on the Trade Center site, however, but on\n",
      "all of lower Manhattan. Further, many believe that the 10 million square\n",
      "feet either could be located elsewhere, scattered in several sites, or\n",
      "simply never rebuilt.\n",
      "\n",
      "These proposals miss the point. What was destroyed, and what must be\n",
      "recovered, was the Trade Center, not all of lower Manhattan. Except over\n",
      "the towers' footprints, where there must be no commercial development, the\n",
      "office and retail space lost has to be rebuilt on or close to where it was.\n",
      "\n",
      "Access to mass transit makes the site ideal for office space of this size.\n",
      "That was a major reason why the Twin Towers were leased to 97% occupancy\n",
      "before 9/11. None of the other sites proposed for office development has\n",
      "remotely equal transportation access. With the reconstruction of the subway\n",
      "and PATH stations, plus an additional $4.5 billion in transit improvements\n",
      "planned, such as the new Fulton Transit Center and the direct\n",
      "\"Train-to-the-Plane\" Long Island Rail Road connection, the site becomes\n",
      "even more the logical locus of office development.\n",
      "\n",
      "And New York will need the space. Before 9/11, the Group of 35, a task\n",
      "force of civic leaders led by Sen. Charles Schumer and former Treasury\n",
      "Secretary Robert Rubin, concluded that the city would need an additional 60\n",
      "million square feet of new office space by 2020 to accommodate the\n",
      "anticipated addition of 300,000 new jobs. The loss of the Twin Towers only\n",
      "heightens the need.\n",
      "\n",
      "As for those who say that 10 million square feet of office space downtown\n",
      "cannot be absorbed by the real estate market, I would simply point out that\n",
      "history shows them wrong. New York now has about 400 million square feet of\n",
      "office space. All new construction underway already is substantially leased\n",
      "up. New York had 48 million square feet of vacant office space at the\n",
      "beginning of the recession in 1990. By 1998, this space had been absorbed,\n",
      "at an annual rate of about 6 million square feet.\n",
      "\n",
      "We are seeking to rebuild 10 million square feet on the Trade Center site\n",
      "over a period of about 10 years, with the first buildings not coming on\n",
      "line until 2008 and the project reaching completion in 2012. This is an\n",

      "That was the case when three men hunting sheep near a high glacier in\n",

      "Hunters followed the game. They returned for centuries and discarded\n",
      "some equipment in the ice. \"We've got people hunting with throwing darts\n",

      "which argued that the \"mass public\" is much less casualty-averse than the\n",
      "military or the civilian élite believes; for example, the study showed that\n",
      "the public would tolerate thirty thousand deaths in a military operation to\n",
      "prevent Iraq from acquiring weapons of mass destruction. (The American\n",
      "death total in the Vietnam War was about fifty-eight thousand.) September\n",

      "The facts were trade and government secrets at the time. But the energy\n",

      "Now, as investigators and regulators unravel the reasons for a financial\n",

      "everyone suspected. Market games helped engineer the price spikes.\n",
      "\n",
      "The latest manipulation was highlighted in Monday's finding by a federal\n",
      "administrative law judge, who said a dominant natural-gas company squeezed\n",
      "supplies in order to squeeze customers. His ruling came a few days after\n",
      "California's Public Utilities Commission reported that electricity\n",
      "generators mysteriously failed to use available capacity during the crunch,\n",
      "also driving up prices.\n",
      "\n",
      "And don't forget the sleazy games by energy traders who gleefully worked\n",
      "the system, in schemes best summed up by an Enron insider's boast in a\n",
      "memorandum made public in May, that ``Enron gets paid for moving energy to\n",
      "relieve congestion without actually moving any energy or relieving any\n",
      "congestion.''\n",
      "\n",
      "How much of this was illegal, as opposed to simply amoral, remains to be\n",
      "seen. Unfortunately, California's response -- confusion, lawsuits and\n",
      "policy tweaks -- hasn't been sufficient.\n",
      "\n",
      "More unfortunately, even if the state suddenly did all the right things --\n",
      "including a hard-nosed program designed to free ourselves from the gougers'\n",
      "grips -- we would need a willing federal partner. But it's foolish to think\n",
      "that the Bush administration would do much to help one of its least\n",
      "favorite states, or do anything that conflicts with its love of\n",
      "traditional, non-renewable energy sources.\n",

      "If the lawsuits against various energy companies and traders bear any\n",
      "fruit, the best we can expect is to pay off some of the massive debts the\n",
      "state amassed to prevent a total collapse in early 2001. That's a\n",
      "reasonable approach, but don't expect miracles.\n",
      "\n",
      "State policies are moving the wrong way on utility regulation, meanwhile.\n",
      "Instead of relentlessly pursuing smart deregulation -- still a good idea if\n",

      "inject real competition into the market.\n",
      "\n",
      "We do need to recognize that the current system of delivering electricity\n",
      "defies privatization, at least under current conditions. Smart regulation\n",
      "is essential.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the best response to gouging is to use less of what the gougers\n",

      "both.\n",
      "\n",
      "The best recent step is a new state law that slowly but surely ratchets up\n",
      "the use of electricity from renewables. By 2017, California's utilities\n",
      "will have to get 20 percent of their power from solar and other renewable\n",
      "sources. Several power companies are expected to do this even sooner.\n",
      "\n",
      "But this law has an element of old-line thinking, the captive-customer\n",
      "model we need to be getting away from, not sustaining. Lip service to newer\n",

      "By Scott Tyler Shafer\n",
      "August 27, 2002 5:46 am PT\n",
      "\n",
      "DATAPOWER TECHNOLOGY ON Monday unveiled its network device designed \n",
      "specifically to process XML data. Unlike competing solutions that \n",
      "process XML data in software, DataPower's device processes the data in \n",
      "hardware -- a technology achievement that provides greater performance, \n",
      "according to company officials.\n",
      "\n",
      "The new device, dubbed DataPower XA35 XML Accelerator, is the first in a \n",
      "family of products expected from the Cambridge, Mass.-based startup. The \n",
      "DataPower family is based on a proprietary processing core technology \n",
      "called XG3 that does the analysis, parsing, and processing of the XML \n",
      "data.\n",
      "\n",
      "According to Steve Kelly, CEO of DataPower, the XA35 Accelerator was \n",
      "conceived to meet the steady adoption of XML, the anticipated future \n",
      "proliferation of Web services, and as a means to share data between two \n",
      "businesses.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Our vision is to build out an XML-aware infrastructure,\" Kelly said. \n",
      "\"The XA35 is the first of a family.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Kelly explained that converting data into XML increases the file size up \n",
      "to 20 times. This, he said, makes processing the data very taxing on \n",
      "application servers; DataPower believes an inline device is the best \n",
      "alternative.\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition to the large file sizes, security is also of paramount \n",
      "importance in the world of XML.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Today's firewalls are designed to inspect HTTP traffic only,\" Kelly \n",
      "said. \"A SOAP packet with XML will go straight through a firewall. \n",
      "Firewalls are blind to XML today.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Future products in DataPowers family will focus more specifically on \n",
      "security, especially as Web services proliferate, Kelly said.\n",
      "\n",
      "According to DataPower, most existing solutions to offload XML \n",
      "processing are homegrown and done in software -- an approach the company \n",
      "itself tried initially and found to be inadequate with regards to speed \n",
      "and security. After trying the software path, the company turned to \n",
      "creating a solution that would process XML in hardware.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Our XG3 execution core converts XML to machine code,\" said Kelly, \n",
      "adding that to his knowledge no other company's solution does. Kelly \n",
      "said in the next few months he expects the market to be flooded with \n",
      "technologies that claim to do XML processing -- claims that he believes \n",
      "will be mostly false.\n",
      "Other content-aware switches, such as SSL (secure socket layer) \n",
      "accelerators and load balancers, look at the first 64 bytes of a packet, \n",
      "while the XA35 provides deeper packet inspection, looking at 1,400 bytes \n",
      "and thus enabling greater processing of XML data, Kelly explained.\n",
      "\n",
      "The 1U-high network device has been tested against a large collection of \n",
      "XML and XSL data types and can learn new flavors of the markup language \n",
      "as they pass through the device.\n",
      "\n",
      "The XA35 can be deployed in proxy mode behind a firewall and a load \n",
      "balancer, and it will inspect all traffic that passes and will identify \n",
      "and process those packets that are XML, Kelly said.\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition to proxy mode, the device can also be used as an application \n",
      "co-processor. This deployment method gives administrators more granular \n",
      "control over what data is inspected and the application server itself \n",
      "controls the device.\n",

      "> The 1U-high network device has been tested against a large \n",

      "data.\n",
      "\n",
      "According to Steve Kelly, CEO of DataPower, the XA35 Accelerator was \n",
      "conceived to meet the steady adoption of XML, the anticipated future \n",
      "proliferation of Web services, and as a means to share data between two \n",
      "businesses.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Our vision is to build out an XML-aware infrastructure,\" Kelly said. \n",
      "\"The XA35 is the first of a family.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Kelly explained that converting data into XML increases the file size up\n",
      "\n",
      "to 20 times. This, he said, makes processing the data very taxing on \n",
      "application servers; DataPower believes an inline device is the best \n",
      "alternative.\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition to the large file sizes, security is also of paramount \n",
      "importance in the world of XML.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Today's firewalls are designed to inspect HTTP traffic only,\" Kelly \n",
      "said. \"A SOAP packet with XML will go straight through a firewall. \n",
      "Firewalls are blind to XML today.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Future products in DataPowers family will focus more specifically on \n",
      "security, especially as Web services proliferate, Kelly said.\n",
      "\n",
      "According to DataPower, most existing solutions to offload XML \n",
      "processing are homegrown and done in software -- an approach the company\n",
      "\n",
      "itself tried initially and found to be inadequate with regards to speed \n",
      "and security. After trying the software path, the company turned to \n",
      "creating a solution that would process XML in hardware.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Our XG3 execution core converts XML to machine code,\" said Kelly, \n",
      "adding that to his knowledge no other company's solution does. Kelly \n",
      "said in the next few months he expects the market to be flooded with \n",
      "technologies that claim to do XML processing -- claims that he believes \n",
      "will be mostly false.\n",
      "Other content-aware switches, such as SSL (secure socket layer) \n",
      "accelerators and load balancers, look at the first 64 bytes of a packet,\n",
      "\n",
      "while the XA35 provides deeper packet inspection, looking at 1,400 bytes\n",
      "\n",
      "and thus enabling greater processing of XML data, Kelly explained.\n",
      "\n",
      "The 1U-high network device has been tested against a large collection of\n",
      "\n",
      "XML and XSL data types and can learn new flavors of the markup language \n",
      "as they pass through the device.\n",
      "\n",
      "The XA35 can be deployed in proxy mode behind a firewall and a load \n",
      "balancer, and it will inspect all traffic that passes and will identify \n",
      "and process those packets that are XML, Kelly said.\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition to proxy mode, the device can also be used as an application\n",
      "\n",
      "co-processor. This deployment method gives administrators more granular \n",
      "control over what data is inspected and the application server itself \n",

      "> Last year, my middle son, in eighth grade and encountering his first \n",
      "> fairly serious American-history course, indignantly reported that the \n",

      "> Just look at my textbook, he said, and when I did I saw his point. His \n",

      "> there was some of that. But the main difference between my son's text \n",
      "> and that of my own childhood was that somebody had made the disastrous \n",
      "> decision to devote most of it to what had actually happened in American \n",
      "> history. There were pages and pages on tariffs and bank charters and \n",
      "> reciprocal trade agreements. I skipped ahead, past the Civil War, hoping \n",
      "> for easier going, only to encounter currency floats and the regulation \n",
      "> of freight rates. Only a few decades into the twentieth century did it \n",
      "> become possible to see the federal government's main function as \n",
      "> responding to dramatic crises and launching crusades for social justice, \n",
      "> instead of attempting to referee competing claims from economic interests.\n",
      "> \n",
      "> Even now, if one were to reveal what really goes on behind the pretty \n",
      "> speeches and the sanctimonious hearings in Washington, what you'd find \n",
      "> is thousands of lawyers and lobbyists madly vying for advantage, not so \n",
      "> much over the public as over each other: agribusiness versus real \n",
      "> estate, banks versus insurance companies, and so on. The arena in which \n",
      "> this competition mainly takes place is regulatory agencies and \n",
      "> commissions and the congressional committees that supervise them. It's \n",
      "> an insider's game, less because the players are secretive than because \n",
      "> the public and the press—encouraged by the players, who speak in jargon—\n",
      "> can't get themselves interested.\n",
      "> \n",
      "> One corner of Washington might be called F.C.C. World, for the Federal \n",
      "> Communications Commission. F.C.C. World has perhaps five thousand \n",
      "> denizens. They work at the commission itself, at the House and Senate \n",
      "> commerce committees, and at the Washington offices of the companies that \n",
      "> the commission regulates. They read Communications Daily (subscription \n",
      "> price: $3,695 a year), and every year around Christmastime they \n",
      "> grumblingly attend the Chairman's Dinner, at a Washington hotel, where \n",
      "> the high point of the evening is a scripted, supposedly self-deprecating \n",
      "> comedy routine by the commission's chairman.\n",
      "> \n",
      "> Of all the federal agencies and commissions, the F.C.C. is the one that \n",
      "> Americans ought to be most interested in; after all, it is involved with \n",
      "> a business sector that accounts for about fifteen per cent of the \n",
      "> American economy, as well as important aspects of daily life—telephone \n",
      "> and television and radio and newspapers and the Internet. And right now \n",
      "> F.C.C. World is in, if not a crisis, at least a very soapy lather, \n",
      "> because a good portion of what the angry public thinks of as the \n",
      "> \"corporate scandals\" concerns the economic collapse of companies \n",
      "> regulated by the F.C.C. Qwest, WorldCom, Adelphia, and Global Crossing, \n",
      "> among others, are (or were) part of F.C.C. World. AOL Time Warner is \n",
      "> part of F.C.C. World. Jack Grubman, the former Salomon Smith Barney \n",
      "> analyst who seems to have succeeded Kenneth Lay, of Enron, as the \n",
      "> embodiment of the corporate scandals, is part of F.C.C. World. In the \n",
      "> past two years, companies belonging to F.C.C. World have lost trillions \n",
      "> of dollars in stock-market valuation, and have collectively served as a \n",
      "> dead weight pulling down the entire stock market.\n",
      "> \n",
      "> This year, an alarmed and acerbic anonymous memorandum about the state \n",
      "> of the F.C.C. has been circulating widely within F.C.C. World. It evokes \n",
      "> F.C.C. World's feverish mood (\"The F.C.C. is fiddling while Rome burns\") \n",
      "> and suggests why nobody besides residents of F.C.C. World has thought of \n",
      "> the commission in connection with the corporate scandals. The sentence I \n",
      "> just quoted is followed by this explanation: \"The ILECs appear likely to \n",
      "> enter all l.d. markets within twelve months, while losing virtually no \n",
      "> residential customers to attackers since 1996, and suffering about 10% \n",
      "> market share loss in business lines to CLECs.\" It's a lot easier to \n",
      "> think about evil C.E.O.s than to decipher that.\n",
      "> \n",
      "> \n",
      "> Even in good times, F.C.C. World pays obsessive attention to the \n",
      "> commission's chairman. In bad times, the attention becomes especially \n",
      "> intense; and when the chairman is a celebrity F.C.C. World devotes \n",
      "> itself to full-time chairman-watching. The current chairman, Michael \n",
      "> Powell, is a celebrity, at least by government-official standards, \n",
      "> because he is the only son of Colin Powell, the Secretary of State. \n",
      "> Unlike his father, he has a kind of mesmerizing ambiguity, which \n",
      "> generates enormous, and at times apoplectically toned, speculation about \n",
      "> who he really is and what he's really up to. Powell is young to be the \n",
      "> head of a federal agency—he is thirty-nine—and genially charming. \n",
      "> Everybody likes him. Before becoming chairman, he was for three years \n",
      "> one of the F.C.C.'s five commissioners; not only is he fluent in the \n",
      "> F.C.C.'s incomprehensible patois, he has a Clintonesque love of the \n",
      "> arcane details of communications policy. He's always saying that he's an \n",
      "> \"avid moderate.\" And yet he has a rage-inciting quality. One of his \n",
      "> predecessors as chairman, Reed Hundt, quoted in Forbes, compared Powell \n",
      "> to Herbert Hoover. Mark Cooper, of the Consumer Federation of America, \n",
      "> calls him \"radical and extreme.\" Just as often as he's accused of being \n",
      "> a right-wing ideologue, Powell gets accused of being paralytically \n",
      "> cautious. \"It ain't about singing 'Kum-Ba-Yah' around the campfire,\" \n",
      "> another former chairman, William Kennard, says. \"You have to have an \n",
      "> answer.\" One day last spring, Powell, testifying before a Senate \n",
      "> subcommittee, delivered an anodyne opening statement, and the \n",
      "> subcommittee's chairman, Ernest Hollings, of South Carolina, berated \n",
      "> him. \"You don't care about these regulations,\" Hollings said. \"You don't \n",
      "> care about the law or what Congress sets down. . . . That's the \n",
      "> fundamental. That's the misgiving I have of your administration over \n",
      "> there. It just is amazing to me. You just pell-mell down the road and \n",
      "> seem to not care at all. I think you'd be a wonderful executive \n",
      "> vice-president of a chamber of commerce, but not a chairman of a \n",
      "> regulatory commission at the government level. Are you happy in your job?\"\n",
      "> \n",
      "> \"Extremely,\" Powell said, with an amiable smile.\n",
      "> \n",
      "> \n",
      "> One cannot understand Powell's maddening effect, at least on Democrats \n",
      "> and liberal activists, without understanding not just the stated purpose \n",
      "> of the commission he chairs but also its real purpose. The F.C.C. was \n",
      "> created by Congress in 1934, but it existed in prototype well before the \n",
      "> New Deal, because it performs a function that is one of the classic easy \n",
      "> cases for government intervention in the private economy: making sure \n",
      "> that broadcasters stick to their assigned spots on the airwaves. Its \n",
      "> other original function was preventing American Telephone & Telegraph, \n",
      "> the national monopoly phone company, from treating its customers \n",
      "> unfairly. Over the decades, as F.C.C. World grew up into a comfortable, \n",
      "> well-established place, the F.C.C. segued into the role of industrial \n",
      "> supervision—its real purpose. It was supposed to manage the competition \n",
      "> among communications companies so that it didn't become too bloody, by \n",
      "> artfully deciding who would be allowed to enter what line of business. \n",
      "> In addition to looking out for the public's interest, the commission \n",
      "> more specifically protected the interests of members of Congress, many \n",
      "> of whom regard the media companies in their districts as the single most \n",
      "> terrifying category of interest group—you can cross the local bank \n",
      "> president and live to tell the tale, but not the local broadcaster. \n",
      "> According to an oft-told F.C.C. World anecdote, President Clinton once \n",
      "> blocked an attempt to allow television stations to buy daily newspapers \n",
      "> in the same city because, he said, if the so-and-so who owned the \n",
      "> anti-Clinton Little Rock Democrat-Gazette had owned the leading TV \n",
      "> station in Little Rock, too, Clinton would never have become President.\n",
      "> \n",
      "> \n",
      "> F.C.C. World may have been con tentious, but it was settled, too, \n",
      "> because all the reasonably powerful players had created secure economic \n",
      "> niches for themselves. Then, in the nineteen-eighties, the successful \n",
      "> breakup of A.T. & T.—by far the biggest and most important company the \n",
      "> commission regulated—deposited a thick additional sediment of \n",
      "> self-confidence onto the consciousness of F.C.C. World. A generation \n",
      "> ago, for most Americans, there was one local phone company, one \n",
      "> long-distance company, and one company that manufactured telephones, \n",
      "> which customers were not permitted to own—and they were all the same \n",
      "> company. It was illegal to plug any device into a phone line. By the \n",
      "> mid-nineteen-nineties, there were a dozen economically viable local \n",
      "> phone companies, a handful of national long-distance companies competing \n",
      "> to offer customers the lowest price and best service, and stores \n",
      "> everywhere selling telephone equipment from many manufacturers—and \n",
      "> millions of Americans had a fax machine and a modem operating over the \n",
      "> telephone lines. A.T. & T. had argued for years that it was a \"natural \n",
      "> monopoly,\" requiring protection from economic competition and total \n",
      "> control over its lines. So much for that argument. Over the same period, \n",
      "> the F.C.C. had assisted in the birth of cable television and cell phones \n",
      "> and the Internet. It was the dream of federal-agency success come true: \n",
      "> consumers vastly better served, and the industry much bigger and more \n",
      "> prosperous, too.\n",
      "> \n",
      "> The next big step was supposed to be the Telecommunications Act of 1996, \n",
      "> one of those massive, endlessly lobbied-over pieces of legislation which \n",
      "> most people outside F.C.C. World probably felt it was safe to ignore. \n",
      "> Although the Telecom Act sailed under the rhetorical banner of \n",
      "> modernization and deregulation, its essence was a grand interest-group \n",
      "> bargain, in which the local phone companies, known to headline writers \n",
      "> as \"baby Bells\" and to F.C.C. World as \"arbocks\" (the pronounced version \n",
      "> of RBOCs, or regional Bell operating companies), would be permitted to \n",
      "> offer long-distance service in exchange for letting the long-distance \n",
      "> companies and smaller new phone companies use their lines to compete for \n",
      "> customers. Consumers would win, because for the first time they would \n",
      "> get the benefits of competition in local service while getting even more \n",
      "> competition than they already had in long distance. But the politics and \n",
      "> economics of the Telecom Act (which was shepherded through Congress by \n",
      "> Vice-President Gore) were just as important. Democrats saw the act as \n",
      "> helping to reposition them as the technology party—the party that \n",
      "> brought the Internet into every home, created hundreds of thousands of \n",
      "> jobs in new companies, and, not least, set off an investment boom whose \n",
      "> beneficiaries might become the party's new contributor base. Clinton's \n",
      "> slogans about the \"information superhighway\" and \"building a bridge to \n",
      "> the twenty-first century,\" which, like all Clinton slogans, artfully \n",
      "> sent different messages to different constituencies, were the rhetorical \n",
      "> correlates of the Telecom Act, and Gore's cruise to the Presidency was \n",
      "> supposed to be powered substantially by the act's success.\n",
      "> \n",
      "> The F.C.C. had a crucial role in all this. The arbocks are rich, \n",
      "> aggressive, politically powerful, and generally Republican (though like \n",
      "> all important interest groups they work with both parties); they \n",
      "> immediately filed lawsuits, which wound up tying the hands of their new \n",
      "> competitors in the local phone market for more than three years. Through \n",
      "> rule-making, enforcement, and litigation, the F.C.C., then headed by \n",
      "> Reed Hundt, who was Gore's classmate at St. Albans, was supposed to keep \n",
      "> the arbocks in their cages, so that not only long-distance companies \n",
      "> like A.T. & T. and MCI WorldCom but also a whole category of new \n",
      "> companies, \"see-lecks\" (the pronounced version of CLECs, or competitive \n",
      "> local exchange carriers), could emerge. This entailed the regulatory \n",
      "> equivalent of hand-to-hand combat: the see-leck is supposed to have \n",
      "> access to the arbock's switching equipment, the arbock won't give the \n",
      "> seeleck a key to the room where it's kept, so the see-leck asks the \n",
      "> F.C.C. to rule that the arbock has to give it the key.\n",
      "> \n",
      "> Partly because Hundt assured the see-lecks and other new companies that \n",
      "> he would protect them, and partly because of the generally booming \n",
      "> condition of the economy then, investment capital flooded into the \n",
      "> see-lecks—companies with names like Winstar, Covad, and Teligent—and \n",
      "> into other telecommunications companies. Even not obviously related \n",
      "> technology companies like Cisco Systems benefitted from the telecom \n",
      "> boom: demand for their products was supposed to come from the see-lecks \n",
      "> and other new players. There would be no conflict between the interests \n",
      "> of the new telecom companies and those of consumers; as one of Hundt's \n",
      "> former lieutenants told me, \"Reed used to joke that my job was to make \n",
      "> sure that all prices went down and all stocks went up.\"\n",
      "> \n",
      "> \n",
      "> The years following the passage of the Telecom Act were the peak of the \n",
      "> boom. Wall Street had its blood up, and that meant not just more \n",
      "> startups but also more mergers of existing communications companies: \n",
      "> Time Warner and AOL decided to throw in together, and A.T. & T. and \n",
      "> Comcast, and so on. (Surely, WorldCom and the other telecom bad guys \n",
      "> believed that their self-dealing, stock-overselling, and creative \n",
      "> accounting would go unnoticed because the market was so undiscriminating.)\n",
      "> \n",
      "> By the time the outcome of the 2000 Presidential election had been \n",
      "> determined, the telecom crash was well under way. Nonetheless, the \n",
      "> chairmanship of the F.C.C. remained one of the best jobs, in terms of \n",
      "> influence and visibility, available to a career government regulator. \n",
      "> Three Republicans emerged as candidates: Powell, who was a commissioner; \n",
      "> Harold Furchtgott-Roth, the farthest-to-the-right commissioner; and \n",
      "> Patrick Wood, the head of the Texas Public Utility Commission and, as \n",
      "> such, a George W. Bush guy. In Texas, however, Wood had crossed the most \n",
      "> powerful person in the arbock camp, Edward Whitacre, the C.E.O. of \n",
      "> S.B.C. Communications, which is headquartered in San Antonio. This meant \n",
      "> that the arbocks didn't want Wood as head of the F.C.C., because he \n",
      "> might be too pro-see-leck. (Wood is now the head of the Federal Energy \n",
      "> Regulatory Commission.) Michael Powell had to signal the arbocks that he \n",
      "> wasn't as threatening as Wood, while also signalling the conservative \n",
      "> movement that he was only negligibly farther to the left than \n",
      "> Furchtgott-Roth.\n",
      "> \n",
      "> Powell did this deftly. For example, in December of 2000 he appeared \n",
      "> before a conservative group called the Progress & Freedom Foundation and \n",
      "> gave a very Michael Powell speech—whimsical, intellectual, and \n",
      "> free-associative (Biblical history, Joseph Schumpeter, Moore's Law)—that \n",
      "> began by making fun of the idea that the F.C.C. should try to keep new \n",
      "> telecom companies alive. \"In the wake of the 1996 Act, the F.C.C. is \n",
      "> often cast as the Grinch who stole Christmas,\" Powell said. \"Like the \n",
      "> Whos, down in Who-ville, who feast on Who-pudding and rare Who-roast \n",
      "> beast, the communications industry was preparing to feast on the \n",
      "> deregulatory fruits it believed would inevitably sprout from the Act's \n",
      "> fertile soil. But this feast the F.C.C. Grinch did not like in the \n",
      "> least, so it is thought.\" Thus Powell was indicating that if he became \n",
      "> chairman he didn't expect to administer first aid to the see-lecks as \n",
      "> part of the job. He was appointed to the chairmanship on the first day \n",
      "> of the Bush Administration.\n",
      "> \n",
      "> Twenty months into the Administration, nearly all the see-lecks are dead \n",
      "> or dying; nearly all long-distance companies, not just WorldCom, are in \n",
      "> serious trouble; cable companies have lost half their value; satellite \n",
      "> companies are staggering. The crash has had an automatically \n",
      "> concentrating effect, because as new companies die the existing \n",
      "> companies' market share increases, and, if the existing companies are in \n",
      "> good shape financially, they have the opportunity to pick up damaged \n",
      "> companies at bargain prices. During the Bush Administration, as the \n",
      "> financial carnage in communications has worsened, the communications \n",
      "> industry has moved in the direction of more concentration. If the Bells \n",
      "> wind up protecting their regional monopolies in local phone service, and \n",
      "> if they also merge, the country will be on its way to having a national \n",
      "> duopoly in local service: Verizon, in the East, and S.B.C., in the West. \n",
      "> And these companies could dominate long distance as well, because of the \n",
      "> poor health of the long-distance companies.\n",
      "> \n",
      "> The cable business also seems close to having two dominant national \n",
      "> companies, AOL Time Warner and Comcast. Unlike the phone companies, they \n",
      "> don't have to share their wiring with other companies and so can more \n",
      "> fully control what material they allow to enter people's homes. As part \n",
      "> of the complicated bargaining with interest groups that led to the 1996 \n",
      "> Telecom Act, the limits on concentration in the radio industry were \n",
      "> significantly loosened, and in the past six years the number of \n",
      "> radio-station owners in the United States has been cut by twenty-five \n",
      "> per cent; today, a large portion of local and national radio news \n",
      "> programming is supplied by a single company, Westwood One, a subsidiary \n",
      "> of Viacom.\n",
      "> \n",
      "> In this situation, many Democrats and liberals think, the F.C.C. should \n",
      "> be hyperactive—the superhero of government regulation, springing to the \n",
      "> rescue of both consumers and the communications industry. It should try \n",
      "> to breathe life into the see-lecks and other new companies. It should \n",
      "> disallow mergers, maintain ownership limits, and otherwise restrain the \n",
      "> forces of concentration. It should use the government's money and muscle \n",
      "> to get new technology—especially fast Internet connections—into the \n",
      "> homes of people who can't afford it at current market prices. (An \n",
      "> analogy that a lot of people in F.C.C. World make is between telecom and \n",
      "> the Middle East: the Clinton people blame the bloodshed on the Bush \n",
      "> people, because they disengaged when they came into office, and the Bush \n",
      "> people blame it on the Clinton people, because they raised too many \n",
      "> expectations and stirred too many passions.)\n",
      "> \n",
      "> But Michael Powell's F.C.C. has not been hyperactive. Powell has been \n",
      "> conducting internal policy reviews and reforming the management of the \n",
      "> F.C.C. and waiting for the federal courts and the Congress to send him \n",
      "> signals. (In mid-September, Powell finally initiated a formal review of \n",
      "> the F.C.C.'s limits on media concentration.) This doesn't mean he has \n",
      "> been inactive; rather, he has been active in a way that further \n",
      "> infuriates his critics—in a manner that smoothly blends the genial and \n",
      "> the provocative, he muses about whether the fundamental premises of \n",
      "> F.C.C. World really make sense, while giving the impression that he's \n",
      "> having the time of his life as chairman. At his first press conference, \n",
      "> when he was asked what he was going to do about the \"digital \n",
      "> divide\"—that is, economic inequality in access to the Internet—he said, \n",
      "> \"You know, I think there is a Mercedes divide. I'd like to have one and \n",
      "> I can't afford one.\" At the National Cable & Telecommunications \n",
      "> Association convention, in Chicago, Powell, following a troupe of \n",
      "> tumblers to the stage, interrupted his walk to the podium to perform a \n",
      "> somersault.\n",
      "> \n",
      "> \n",
      "> Not long ago, I went to see Powell in his office at the F.C.C. Until \n",
      "> 1998, when the commission moved to a new building in Southwest \n",
      "> Washington, near the city's open-air fish market, F.C.C. World was at \n",
      "> the western edge of downtown, where everybody would encounter everybody \n",
      "> else at a few familiar restaurants and bars. Today, the F.C.C. building \n",
      "> looks like the office of a mortgage company in a suburban office park. \n",
      "> Even the chairman's suite, though large, is beige, carpeted, and \n",
      "> fluorescent. Powell is a bulky man who wears gold-rimmed glasses and \n",
      "> walks with a pronounced limp, the result of injuries he suffered in a \n",
      "> jeep accident in Germany, in 1987, when he was an Army officer. Because \n",
      "> of the accident, he left the Army and went to law school, where he \n",
      "> became entranced with conservative ideas about regulation, particularly \n",
      "> the idea that the government, rather than trying to correct the flaws of \n",
      "> the market before the fact—\"prophylactically,\" as he likes to say—should \n",
      "> wait till the flaws manifest themselves and then use antitrust \n",
      "> litigation to fix them. He worked briefly at a corporate law firm, and \n",
      "> then became a protégé of Joel Klein, the head of the antitrust division \n",
      "> of the Clinton Justice Department and the man who led the government's \n",
      "> legal case against Microsoft. (He was recently appointed chancellor of \n",
      "> the New York public-school system.) It testifies to Powell's political \n",
      "> skill that he is probably the only high official in the Bush \n",
      "> Administration who not only served in the Clinton Administration but \n",
      "> also maintains close ties to Bush's nemesis Senator John McCain, of \n",
      "> Arizona. One of the things about Powell that annoy people is his \n",
      "> enduring love of law school—\"It's sort of like a law-school study \n",
      "> session over there,\" one Democratic former commissioner said. As if to \n",
      "> confirm the charge, Powell, when I arrived, introduced me to four law \n",
      "> students, summer interns at the commission, whom he'd invited to sit in.\n",
      "> \n",
      "> I began by asking Powell whether he agreed with the founding assumptions \n",
      "> of the F.C.C. For example, could private companies have apportioned the \n",
      "> airwaves among themselves without the government being involved?\n",
      "> \n",
      "> \"I think we'll never know,\" Powell said. \"I don't think it's an \n",
      "> automatically bad idea, the way some people will argue. Land is probably \n",
      "> the best analogue. We don't seize all the land in the United States and \n",
      "> say, 'The government will issue licenses to use land.' If my neighbor \n",
      "> puts a fence one foot onto my property line, there's a whole body of law \n",
      "> about what I can do about that, including whether I can tear it down. If \n",
      "> a wireless company was interfering with another wireless company, it's a \n",
      "> similar proposition. There are scholars who argue—indeed, the famous \n",
      "> Ronald Coase treatise that won the Nobel Prize was about this—that \n",
      "> spectrum policy is lunacy. The market could work this out, in the kinds \n",
      "> of ways that we're accustomed to.\"\n",
      "> \n",
      "> Talking to Powell was fun. Unlike most high government officials, he \n",
      "> doesn't seem to be invested in appearing dignified or commanding. He \n",
      "> slumps in his chair and fiddles with his tie and riffs. He speaks in \n",
      "> ironic air quotes. He's like your libertarian friend in college who \n",
      "> enjoyed staying up all night asking impertinent rhetorical questions \n",
      "> about aspects of life that everybody else takes for granted but that he \n",
      "> sees as sentimental or illogical. After a while, I asked him whether he \n",
      "> thought his predecessors' excitement about the 1996 Telecommunications \n",
      "> Act had been excessive.\n",
      "> \n",
      "> \"I would start with a caveat,\" Powell said. \"Look, I can't fault those \n",
      "> judgments in and of themselves, given the time and what people thought. \n",
      "> They were not the only ones who were hysterical about the opportunities. \n",
      "> But, frankly, I've always been a little bit critical. First of all, \n",
      "> anybody who works with the act knows that it doesn't come anywhere close \n",
      "> to matching the hyperbole that was associated with it, by the President \n",
      "> on down, about the kinds of things it's going to open up. I mean, I \n",
      "> don't know what provisions are the information-superhighway provisions, \n",
      "> or what provisions are so digitally oriented, or some of the things that \n",
      "> were a big part of the theatre of its introduction. When one starts \n",
      "> reading the details, one searches, often in vain, for these provisions. \n",
      "> But, nonetheless, there was a rising dot-com excitement, and an Internet \n",
      "> excitement, and people thought this was historic legislation, and it \n",
      "> certainly was.\n",
      "> \n",
      "> \"But. We were sucking helium out of balloons, with the kinds of \n",
      "> expectations that were being bandied around, and this is before the \n",
      "> economy or the market even gets in trouble. It was a dramatically \n",
      "> exaggerated expectation—by the leadership of the commission, by \n",
      "> politicians, by the market itself, by companies themselves. It was a \n",
      "> gold rush, and led to some very detrimental business decisions, ones \n",
      "> that government encouraged by its policies, frankly. Everybody wanted to \n",
      "> see numbers go up on the board.\"\n",
      "> \n",
      "> Powell began imitating an imagined true believer in the Telecom Act. \" \n",
      "> 'I want to see ten competitors. Twenty competitors! I want to see \n",
      "> thirty-per-cent market share. Fifty-per-cent market share! I want the \n",
      "> Bells to bleed! Then we'll know we've succeeded.' \" Now Powell returned \n",
      "> to being Powell. \"I think that expectation was astonishingly \n",
      "> unrealistic, in the short term. They wanted to see it while they're \n",
      "> there. We were starting to get drunk on the juice we were drinking. And \n",
      "> the market was getting drunk on the juice we were drinking. There's no \n",
      "> question, we went too soon too fast. Too many companies took on too much \n",
      "> debt too fast before the market really had a product, or a business model.\"\n",
      "> \n",
      "> How could the Telecom Act have been handled better? \"We could have \n",
      "> chosen policies that were less hellbent on a single objective, and were \n",
      "> slightly more balanced and put more economic discipline in the system,\" \n",
      "> Powell said. \"Money chased what seemed like government-promised \n",
      "> opportunity. The problem with that is there's a morning after, and we're \n",
      "> in it. And the problem is there is no short fix for this problem. This \n",
      "> debt is going to take years to bring down to a realistic level. In some \n",
      "> ways, for short-term gain, we paid a price in long-term stability.\"\n",
      "> \n",
      "> Powell went on to say that it might have turned out differently if there \n",
      "> had been a more \"reasonable\" level of investment. \"No, we wouldn't have \n",
      "> every home in America with competitive choice yet—but we don't anyway. I \n",
      "> don't think it's the remonopolization of telephone service. I don't buy \n",
      "> that. The Bells will prosper, but did anybody believe they wouldn't? The \n",
      "> part of the story that didn't materialize was that people thought so \n",
      "> would MCI WorldCom and Sprint.\"\n",
      "> \n",
      "> Other local phone companies, he added, hadn't materialized as viable \n",
      "> businesses, either, and they never might. \"Everybody's always saying, \n",
      "> 'The regulators did this and this and this.' But, candidly, the story's \n",
      "> quite the opposite. I think the regulators bent over backward for six \n",
      "> years to give them a chance. Conditions don't get that good except once \n",
      "> every thirty years, and it didn't happen. So, whatever the reason, we're \n",
      "> looking at a WorldCom that's teetering. We're looking at a long-distance \n",
      "> business that has had a rapid decline in its revenue base. A.T. & T. is \n",
      "> breaking itself up. Sprint has struggled.\"\n",
      "> \n",
      "> Could the F.C.C. have done anything to make the long-distance companies \n",
      "> stronger? \"At the F.C.C.? I think I'll just be blunt. My political \n",
      "> answer? Yes, there's all kinds of things we can do at the margin to try \n",
      "> to help. But I can't find thirty billion dollars for WorldCom somewhere. \n",
      "> I can't mitigate the impacts of an accounting scandal and an S.E.C. \n",
      "> investigation. Were I king, it would be wonderful, but I don't have \n",
      "> those kinds of levers. I don't know whether anybody does. At some point, \n",
      "> companies are expected to run themselves in a way that keeps them from \n",
      "> dying.\" Powell couldn't have made it much clearer that he doesn't think \n",
      "> it's his responsibility to do anything about the telecom crash. He has \n",
      "> demonstrated his sure political touch by making accommodationist \n",
      "> gestures—in August, for example, five months after disbanding the \n",
      "> F.C.C.'s Accounting Safeguards Division, Powell announced that he was \n",
      "> appointing a committee to study accounting standards in the \n",
      "> communications industry. But that shows that Powell is better at riding \n",
      "> out the storm than, say, Harvey Pitt, his counterpart at the Securities \n",
      "> and Exchange Commission, and does not mean that he plans to try to shore \n",
      "> up the telecom industry.\n",
      "> \n",
      "> I asked Powell if it would bother him if, for most people, only one \n",
      "> company provided cable television and only one provided local phone \n",
      "> service. \"Yes,\" he said. \"It concerns us that there's one of each of \n",
      "> those things, but let's not diminish the importance of there being one \n",
      "> of each of those things. That still is a nice suite of communications \n",
      "> capabilities, even if they aren't direct analogues of each other.\" \n",
      "> Anyway, Powell said, before long the phone companies will be able to \n",
      "> provide video service over their lines, and the cable companies will \n",
      "> provide data service over their lines, so there will be more choice. \n",
      "> \"So, yeah, we have this anxiety: we have one of everything. The question \n",
      "> is, Does it stay that way?\"\n",
      "> \n",
      "> The concentration of ownership and the concentrated control of \n",
      "> information did not appear to trouble Powell, either. He said that \n",
      "> people confuse bigness, which brings many benefits, with concentration, \n",
      "> which distorts markets. \"If this were just economics, it's easy. If you \n",
      "> were to say to me, 'Mike, just worry about economic concentration,' we \n",
      "> know how to do that—the econometrics of antitrust. I can tell you when a \n",
      "> market's too concentrated and prices are going to rise. The problem is \n",
      "> other dimensions, like political, ideological, sometimes emotional. Take \n",
      "> the question of, if everybody's controlling what you see, the assumption \n",
      "> there is that somehow there'll be this viewpoint, a monolithic \n",
      "> viewpoint, pushed on you by your media and you won't get diversity. I \n",
      "> think that's a possibility. I don't think it's nearly the possibility \n",
      "> that's ascribed to it sometimes.\"\n",
      "> \n",
      "> Powell explained, \"Sometimes when we see very pointed political or \n",
      "> parochial programming, it gets attacked as unfair. I see some of the \n",
      "> same people who claim they want diversity go crazy when Rush Limbaugh \n",
      "> exists. They love diversity, but somehow we should run Howard Stern off \n",
      "> the planet. If it has a point of view, then it becomes accused of bias, \n",
      "> and then we have policies like\"—here his tone went from ironic to \n",
      "> sarcastic—\"the fairness doctrine, which seems to me like the antithesis \n",
      "> of what I thought those people cared about. So when somebody is pointed \n",
      "> and opinionated, we do all this stuff in the name of journalistic \n",
      "> fairness and integrity or whatever, to make them balance it out.\"\n",
      "> \n",
      "> \n",
      "> F.C.C. World abounds in theories about Michael Powell. One is that he \n",
      "> can't make up his mind about how to address the crisis in the industries \n",
      "> he regulates—so he talks (and talks and talks) flamboyantly about the \n",
      "> market, in order to buy himself time. Another is that he's carrying \n",
      "> water for the arbocks and the big cable companies. Another is that he is \n",
      "> planning to run for the Senate from Virginia (or to be appointed \n",
      "> Attorney General in a second Bush term), and doesn't want to do anything \n",
      "> at the F.C.C. that would diminish his chances. Another is that he's \n",
      "> waiting to move until there is more consensus on some course of action, \n",
      "> so that he doesn't wind up going first and getting caught in the \n",
      "> crossfire between the arbocks and the cable companies and the television \n",
      "> networks. (In F.C.C. World, this is known as the Powell Doctrine of \n",
      "> Telecom, after Colin Powell's idea that the United States should never \n",
      "> commit itself militarily without a clear objective, overwhelming force, \n",
      "> and an exit strategy.) And another is that he actually believes what he \n",
      "> says, and thinks the telecommunications crash is natural, healthy, and \n",
      "> irreversible, and more concentration would be just fine.\n",
      "> \n",
      "> \"This is why elections matter,\" Reed Hundt, who isn't happy about what \n",
      "> has become of his Telecom Act, told me. It's true that the F.C.C.—much \n",
      "> more than, say, the war in Afghanistan—is a case in which a Gore \n",
      "> Administration would be acting quite differently from the Bush \n",
      "> Administration. Consumers might have noticed the difference by now, but \n",
      "> there's no question whether communications companies have noticed. The \n",
      "> arbocks are doing better against their internal rivals than they would \n",
      "> have done if Gore had won. Next election, they'll help the party that \n",
      "> helped them. If the Republicans win, policy will tilt further in the \n",
      "> arbocks' favor. If they lose, perhaps the arbocks' rivals—the \n",
      "> long-distance companies and the telecommunications upstarts—with their \n",
      "> friends now in power, will stage a comeback. America's present is not \n",

      "purse snug in his coat pocket.  An hour after the robbery the woman was\n",
      "found in a distracted condition, but failed to give a description of her\n",
